1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>It is said of a stranger who came to London for the first
time, and took up his quarters in one of the most crowded city
streets, that he remained standing at the door the whole of the
first day of his London existence, because he waited until the
crowd had gone.&nbsp; A man, says Max Schlesinger, who would do
that, ought to rise and go to bed with the owl.&nbsp; The owl is
the symbol of wisdom; for once I would prevail upon the reader to
do as the owls do, and become wise as they.&nbsp; You may live at
Clapham all your life, come into <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the city every
day, attend on a gospel ministry, as the slang phrase
is,&mdash;for it is not only wicked people that talk
slang,&mdash;and know no more of London than the British public
do of Timbuctoo.</p>
<p>Think of what London is.&nbsp; At the last census there were
2,362,236 persons of both sexes in it; 1,106,558 males, of whom
146,449 were under 5 years of age; and 1,255,678 females, of whom
147,173 were under 5 years of age.&nbsp; The unmarried males were
679,380, ditto females 735,871; the married men were 399,098, the
wives 409,731; the widowers were 37,080, the widows
110,076.&nbsp; On the night of the census there were 28,598
husbands whose wives were not with them, and 39,231 wives
mourning their absent lords.&nbsp; In 1856 the number of children
born in London was 86,833, only one in 25 of which is
illegitimate; in the same period 56,786 persons died.&nbsp; The
Registrar-General assumes that, with the additional births, and
by the fact of soldiers and sailors returning from the seat of
war, and of persons engaged in peaceful pursuits settling in the
capital, sustenance, clothing, and house accommodation must now
be found in London for about 60,000 inhabitants <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>more than it
contained at the end of 1855.&nbsp; Think of that&mdash;the
population of a large city absorbed in London, and no perceptible
inconvenience occasioned by it!&nbsp; Houses are still to let;
there are still the usual tickets hung up in windows in quiet
neighbourhoods, intimating that apartments furnished for the use
of single gentlemen can be had within; the country still supplies
the town with meat and bread, and we hear of no starvation in
consequence of deficient supply.&nbsp; London is the healthiest
city in the world.&nbsp; The city death-rate, according to Dr.
Letheby&rsquo;s report for 1857, is 22.5 per 1000, and in all
England it is 22.2.&nbsp; During the last ten years the annual
deaths have been on the average 25 to 1000 of the population, in
1856 the proportion was 22 to 1000; yet, in spite of this, half
of the deaths that happen on an average in London between the
ages of 20 and 40 are from consumption and diseases of the
respiratory organs.&nbsp; The Registrar traces this to the state
of the streets.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;There can be no doubt that
the dirty dust suspended in the air that the people of London
breathe often excites diseases of the respiratory organs.&nbsp;
The dirt of the streets is produced and ground now by innumerable
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>horses, omnibuses, and carriages, and then beat up in
fine dust, which fills the mouth, and inevitably enters the
air-passages in large quantities.&nbsp; The dust is not removed
every day, but, saturated with water in the great thoroughfares,
sometimes ferments in damp weather, and at other times ascends
again under the heat of the summer sun as atmospheric
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>London, says Henry Mayhew, may be safely asserted to be the
most densely populated city in all the world; containing
one-fourth more people than Pekin, and two-thirds more than
Paris&mdash;more than twice as many as Constantinople&mdash;four
times as many as St. Petersburg&mdash;five times as many as
Vienna, or New York, or Madrid&mdash;nearly seven times as many
as Berlin&mdash;eight times as many as Amsterdam&mdash;nine times
as many as Rome&mdash;fifteen times as many as
Copenhagen&mdash;and seventeen times as many as Stockholm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;London,&rdquo; says Horace Say, &ldquo;c&rsquo;est une
province couverte de maisons.&rdquo;&nbsp; It covers an area of
122 square miles in extent, or 78,029 statute acres; and contains
327,391 houses.&nbsp; Annually 4000 new houses are in erection
for upwards of 40,000 new-comers.&nbsp; The continuous line of
buildings stretching from Highgate to <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Camberwell is
said to be 12 miles long.&nbsp; It is computed if the buildings
were set in a row they would reach across the whole of England
and France, from York to the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>When the stone in Panyer&rsquo;s Alley was placed on its site
three centuries since, the circumference was about five
miles.&nbsp; At present, however, to make a pedestrian expedition
around the metropolis would, to most persons, be an undertaking
of some importance, as may be seen by referring to the following
particulars, which have been gathered from a recently published
map:&mdash;From Chiswick to Kentish-town, 12 miles; from
Kentish-town to Millwall, 17&frac12; miles; from Millwall to
Chiswick, 28 miles&mdash;total, 57&frac12; miles, very nearly
three days&rsquo; journey, at the rate of 20 miles a day; and it
will be observed that in the line drawn, Battersea, Clapham,
Canning-town, and many other places, which even at present can be
scarcely said to be separated from London, have been left
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the crow would fly&rdquo; across streets and
houses from the point whence we started at Chiswick to the
farthest east, the distance is nearly eleven miles, and the
greatest width from north to south upwards of seven miles.&nbsp;
The metropolis is divided <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>into 38 different poor-law districts,
some of them parishes, and some of them unions, but each managing
separately their own poor.&nbsp; Of these, 27 are in Middlesex,
two in Kent, and nine in Surrey.&nbsp; Of the 27 in Middlesex, 10
are unions of various extent; 17 are single parishes, many of
them of great extent, and comprising a large amount of property
and population.&nbsp; The unions in Middlesex consist of a small
number of parishes, two consisting of two parishes, two of three,
one of five, one of four, one of six, one of seven, and one of
nine parishes.&nbsp; The city of London consists of 98 parishes,
some of them small in extent, but containing a large amount of
property and population.&nbsp; The unions in Kent consist of four
and seven parishes.&nbsp; Of the nine in Surrey three are unions,
consisting, one of two parishes, another of three, and the third
of six parishes.&nbsp; The remaining six are all single parishes,
each administering its own affairs.&nbsp; The total population of
these districts is 2,500,000; the average number of paupers to be
dealt with 105,000; the amount of expenditure for the year ending
Lady-day, 1856, was &pound;875,000; and the net rateable value of
the property contributing <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to the relief of the poor was
&pound;10,900,000.&nbsp; The proportion which the metropolis bore
to the whole of England and Wales was, as to population,
one-eighth; as to pauperism, one-twelfth.</p>
<p>London has 10,500 distinct streets, squares, circuses,
crescents, terraces, villas, rows, buildings, places, lanes,
courts, alleys, mews, yards, rents.&nbsp; The paved streets of
London, according to a return published in 1856, number over
5000, and exceed 2000 miles in length; the cost of this paved
roading was 14 millions, and the repairs cost &pound;1,800,000
per annum.&nbsp; The Post Office employs 3200 officials in London
alone.&nbsp; London contains 1900 miles of gas pipes, with a
capital of nearly &pound;4,000,000 spent in the preparation of
gas.&nbsp; The cost of gas-lighting is half a million.&nbsp; It
has 360,000 lights; and 13,000,000 cubic feet of gas are burnt
every night.&nbsp; Last year along these streets the enormous
quantity of upwards of 80 millions of gallons of water rushed for
the supply of the inhabitants, being nearly double what it was in
1845.&nbsp; Mr Mayhew says, if the entire people of the capital
were to be drawn up in marching order, two and two, the length of
the great army of Londoners would be no less <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>than 670 miles,
and supposing them to move at the rate of three miles an hour, it
would require more than nine days and nights for the average
population to pass by.&nbsp; To accommodate this crowd, 125,000
vehicles pass through the thoroughfares in the course of 12
hours; 3000 cabs, 10,000 private and job carriages and carts, ply
daily in the streets; at the present time there are upwards of
800 omnibuses running along various routes in the metropolis, and
of this number 595 are the property of a single and mostly
foreign proprietary, the London General Omnibus Company.&nbsp;
600 omnibuses, with horses and harness and goodwill, were
purchased by the company for a sum of &pound;400,000, or for very
nearly &pound;700 for each vehicle.&nbsp; The 595 omnibuses of
the company ran in London, in the week ending 31st of October,
1857, not less than 222,779 miles, or nearly ten times the
circumference of the globe, and they carried not less than
920,000 passengers.&nbsp; Assuming that the remaining one-fourth
of the London omnibuses, not belonging to the company, carried an
equal proportion, we shall have, as the travelling portion of the
population of London, 1,115,000 persons.&nbsp; 3000 conveyances
enter the <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>metropolis daily from the surrounding
country.&nbsp; In the year 1856 the total revenue derived from
the duty on omnibuses within the area of the great metropolis
amounted to &pound;74,270 against &pound;85,965 in 1855, and
&pound;108,051 in 1854.&nbsp; The revenue from cabs in the
metropolis was &pound;82,110 against &pound;75,281, and
&pound;64,210 in 1854.&nbsp; Of the revenue on omnibuses last
year, &pound;69,493 accrued from mileage duty, &pound;3791 from
license duty, and &pound;983 from drivers&rsquo; and
conductors&rsquo; licenses.&nbsp; As regards the cab duty,
&pound;74,736 accrued from weekly duty, &pound;5292 from license
duty, and &pound;2081 from drivers&rsquo; and watermen&rsquo;s
licenses.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, Tennyson tells us&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every minute dies a man,<br />
Every minute one is born.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In London, 169 people die daily, and a babe is born every five
minutes.&nbsp; The number of persons, says the Registrar-General,
who died in 1856, in 116 public institutions, such as workhouses
and hospitals, was 10,381.&nbsp; It is really shocking to think,
and a deep stigma on the people,&mdash;or on the artificial
arrangements of society, by which so much poverty is
perpetuated,&mdash;that nearly one person out of five, who died
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>that year, closed his days under a roof provided by law
or public charity.&nbsp; In 1856 the police report 147
suicides.&nbsp; Dr. Wakley says, 4000 infants die annually of
neglect.&nbsp; It is calculated 500 people are drowned in the
Thames every year.&nbsp; In the first week of last year there
were five deaths from intemperance alone.&nbsp; How much
wretchedness lies in these facts,&mdash;for the deaths from
actual intemperance bear but a small proportion to the deaths
induced by the immoderate use of intoxicating liquors; and of the
500 drowned, by far the larger class, we have every reason to
believe, are of the number of whom Hood wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mad with life&rsquo;s history,<br />
Glad to death&rsquo;s mystery<br />
Swift to be hurled&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Anywhere, anywhere,<br />
Out of the world!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A meeting was held last year of the unemployed, chiefly the
carpenters, bricklayers, and bricklayers&rsquo; labourers of the
metropolis, in which it was stated that their number&mdash;though
very probably there may be some exaggeration here&mdash;is
35,000.&nbsp; If these men are married and have families, we get
a further idea of the deep <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>distress in
this wealthy and luxurious capital,&mdash;this capital where the
gold of Australia, the jewels of Golconda, the silks and spices
of the East, come for sale, and are lavished as freely on the
most questionable purposes and persons as on the noblest
specimens of humanity and the most glorious objects for which men
care to live.&nbsp; Then think of the inmates of the lunatic
asylums, and the poor-houses, and the hospitals, in most cases
sent there as the result of their own ignorance or
imprudence.&nbsp; Last Christmas day the dinners provided at the
workhouses for the inmates fed between 30 and 40,000.&nbsp; Add
to these our prison population, and our criminal classes, and our
prostitutes,&mdash;and what a picture we get of the Night Side of
London, of the classes whose existence is a reproach or a
curse.&nbsp; In London one man in every ninety belongs to the
criminal class.</p>
<p>According to the last reports, there were in London 143,000
vagrants admitted in one year into the casual wards of the
workhouses.&nbsp; In 1856 it appears that in all 73,240 persons
were taken into custody, of whom 45,941 were males, and 27,209
females; 18,000 of the apprehensions were on account of
drunkenness, 8160 for unlawful <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>possession of
goods, 7021 for simple larceny, 6763 for common assaults, 2914
for assaults on the police; 4303 women were taken into custody as
prostitutes.&nbsp; The period of life most prolific of crime is
that between the 20th and 25th years.&nbsp; The convictions upon
trial in 1856 were in the following proportions:&mdash;Under 10
years of age, 1; 10 years and under 15 years, 91; 15 years and
under 20 years, 610; 20 years and under 25 years, 770; 25 years
and under 30 years, 390; 30 years and under 40 years, 410; 40
years and under 50 years, 188; 50 years and under 60 years, 90;
63 years and upwards, 37.&nbsp; The committals for murder in the
year 1856 were 11; they were 12 in 1855, 10 in 1854, 7 in 1853,11
in 1852, 8 in 1851, 11 in 1850, 19 in 1849, 11 in 1848, and 10 in
1847.&nbsp; Of the larcenies in dwelling-houses last year, only
315 were committed by means of false keys, as many as 2175
through doors being left open, 679 by lifting up a window, or
breaking glass, and 31 by entering attic windows from empty
houses.&nbsp; Again, 1595 such larcenies were committed by
lodgers, 1701 by servants, and as many as 673 by means of false
messages.&nbsp; The cases enumerated under the last three heads
are such as the police could hardly be expected to <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>prevent.&nbsp; 2371 persons were reported last year to
the police as lost, and of these the police restored 1084.&nbsp;
The City returns, for which I am indebted to the kindness of G.
Borlase Childs, Esq., surgeon to the force, are for 1856, as
follows: number of persons taken into custody; males 3030,
females 1014; of these, 1083 males and 450 females were
discharged; 1628 males, 517 females were summarily convicted or
held to bail; 319 males and 77 females were committed for trial:
8 males and 1 female under 10 years of age; 322 males and 37
females under 15; 755 males and 152 females under 20; 645 males
and 235 females under 25; 341 males and 165 females under 30; 497
males and 220 females under 40; 300 males and 116 females under
50; 125 males and 78 females under 60; and above that age 41
males and 20 females.&nbsp; Tried by the education test of the
whole number taken into custody, 782 males and 421 females could
neither read nor write; 1925 males and 570 females could read and
write imperfectly; 317 males and 23 females could read and write
well; 6 males come under the head of superior instruction.&nbsp;
The value of property stolen was &pound;11,425; of property
recovered &pound;3829; the return of destitute persons taken in
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>charge by the police is, men 141, women 115, children
79.&nbsp; During the same period 1603 males and 1097 females were
brought to the station house.&nbsp; Children missing and found by
the police; males 496, females 319.&nbsp; The return of the
metropolitan police for 1857, was 2825 brothels, and 8600
prostitutes.&nbsp; In the City, the number of such houses and
persons is very small; the prison population at any particular
time is 6000, costing for the year &pound;170,000.&nbsp; Our
juvenile thieves cost us &pound;300 a-piece.&nbsp; The average
income of the London thief is estimated at &pound;2 per week.</p>
<p>Again, let us look at the classes whose labours and
occupations and modes of life are inconsistent with health, or
not favourable to any great development of moral principle.&nbsp;
Almost 20,000 persons are engaged in Sunday trading; the number
of ragged children is nearly 30,000, the number of families
living in one room is estimated as high as 150,000.&nbsp; It
appears from a report by Mr. Goderich, officer of health in the
parish of Kensington, that in a place called the Potteries there
are 1147 human beings and 1041 pigs congregated within a space of
less than nine acres, the present number of pigs being <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>below
the usual average.&nbsp; The dwellings of a large proportion of
the inhabitants of this locality are mere hovels with shattered
roofs and unglazed windows, the floor is below the level of the
external soil, which has been raised by excessive accumulations
of filth of all kinds, and the walls are at all times partially
damp and giving out pestilential gases, intolerable to those who
have not been born among them, fatal to the health of those who
have.&nbsp; Another portion of the miserable population has
converted old caravan bodies, removed in some cases from their
wheels, into houses; others have no other dwelling than ruinous
post-chaise bodies, for which a rent of sixpence per week is
paid.&nbsp; In one of the caravans eight persons dwell, among
whom a child suffering from small-pox was battling with death at
the time of Mr. Goderich&rsquo;s visit in March.</p>
<p>Mr. Timbs calculates the number of professional beggars in
London at 15,000, two-thirds of whom are Irish.&nbsp; 30,000 men,
women, and children are employed in the costermonger trade;
besides, we have, according to Mr. Mayhew, 2000 street sellers of
green stuff, 4000 street sellers of eatables and drinkables, 1000
street sellers of stationery, 4000 street sellers of other <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>articles, whose receipts are three millions sterling,
and whose incomes may be put down at one.&nbsp; Let us extend our
survey, and we shall not wonder that the public-houses&mdash;and
the gin palaces&mdash;and the casinos&mdash;and the
theatres&mdash;and the penny gaffs&mdash;and the lowest and
vilest places of resort in London, are full.&nbsp; In
Spitalfields there are 70,000 weavers with but 10<i>s.</i> per
week; there are 22,479 tailors, 30,805 shoemakers, 43,928
milliners; seamstresses, 21,210; bonnet-makers, 1769; cap-makers,
1277.&nbsp; What hard, wretched work is theirs!</p>
<p>In the first week of January this present year, a poor woman
named Martha Duke was brought up at the Thames police office,
charged with attempting to commit suicide.&nbsp; She was a poor
needle-woman, and found the misery of that mode of life greater
than could be borne.&nbsp; Speaking not of this case in
particular, but of needlewomen in general, Mr. Burch, the
resident medical officer of the London Hospital, stated that
&ldquo;a large number of patients had been under his care, and he
had carefully investigated a considerable number of cases, and
was satisfied that needle-women were the most ill-paid class of
people and the most hard-working on earth.&nbsp; They <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>were
miserably paid,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and he knew that numbers
of them, with constitutions broken down, earned from 3<i>s.</i>
to 4<i>s.</i> per week only, and for that scanty pittance were
compelled to work from three o&rsquo;clock in the morning till
ten at night.&nbsp; They soon became enfeebled by insufficient
diet and over-work, and when broken down either had recourse to
suicide or prostitution.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1844 the operative
tailors instituted an inquiry into the sweating system, and then
it was found that there were at the West End 676 men, women, and
children working under sweaters, and occupying 92 small rooms,
the majority of which measured eight feet by ten.&nbsp; The
sweater, it may be as well to state, is the man who contracts
with the large houses to supply them with shirts, or clothes, or
any other kind of slop work; the more his victims sweat, the more
are his gains.&nbsp; The sweater is often a Jew, never a
Christian.</p>
<p>Let the reader walk with us to a fashionable clothing
establishment&mdash;a mart, we believe, as it is called.&nbsp;
The building, as you approach it, seems a palace.&nbsp; It is
redolent with polished mahogany and plate-glass and gilt.&nbsp;
You pass it when the lamps are lit, and you think of the <!--
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Arabian Nights.&nbsp; It is illuminated as if peace had
just been proclaimed, or some great national desire had been
realised.&nbsp; You enter with cash, and all is fair and smooth
within.&nbsp; Whatever you want in the way of apparel is there,
and at a price for which no honest tradesman can afford to sell
it.&nbsp; Honest! asks the reader, is not the man honest?&nbsp;
Does he steal the cloth?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; Does he not
pay rent, and taxes, and wages?&nbsp; Most certainly he
does.&nbsp; Do not his creditors all get twenty shillings in the
pound?&nbsp; Most undoubtedly they do; the law protects them, and
with them the man, willing or not, must keep himself right.&nbsp;
So far as they are concerned, honesty is the best policy.&nbsp;
How, then, does he make his profit?&nbsp; How is this monster
establishment maintained?&nbsp; Out of what fund is it that its
glitter and glare are paid for?&nbsp; We shall now see.&nbsp;
Come down this stinking court.&nbsp; Go up those creaking
stairs.&nbsp; Enter that miserable garret.&nbsp; Look at those
men, who know nothing of labour but its curse, and of life but
its misery.&nbsp; Mark the haggard faces already stamped with the
impress of death.&nbsp; If you can bear the polluted atmosphere,
you will hear from these men how they toil from early <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>morning far into the night for two shillings a day; how
for them the fine air and the golden sunshine, and the rest of
the sabbath, exist not; and it is by them, by their sweat and
blood and sinew, that the profit is made.&nbsp; And now go back
and look into the gilded shop, and it will seem to you a
Golgotha&mdash;a place of skulls.&nbsp; Is another illustration
needed?&nbsp; Up in yon miserable chamber, without
fire&mdash;without food&mdash;without furniture&mdash;almost
without clothes, Martha Duke is stitching to earn the few pence
by which she prolongs life, and its misery.&nbsp; Once, youth was
hers, with its bright hopes and joys; but they are gone, and with
an aching heart and pallid brow she plies her daily task.&nbsp;
Is it wonderful that, wanting coals or something better than dry
bread, the shirt or the waistcoat should be pawned?&nbsp; Is it
not more wonderful that such bleak and hopeless poverty should be
so honest as it is?&nbsp; And yet from such poor forlorn,
forgotten women as these, proceed the profits which pay for
dazzling window and gorgeous pile.&nbsp; Is it strange that the
city missionaries for last year show an increase of fallen women
in their districts of 1035?</p>
<p>Bear in mind also that corporal labourers are <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>shorter lived and endure more physical evil than the
mental labourers.&nbsp; The coal-whippers&rsquo; work&mdash;the
most wasteful, unscientific, and pernicious expenditure of human
muscle ever devised, writes Dr Chambers&mdash;overstrains the
fibres of the heart, and the organs become diseased.&nbsp;
Painters again are liable to palsy and colic, from the use of
white lead.&nbsp; The tailor sits till the stomach and bowels
becomes disordered, the spine twisted, the gait shambling, and
the power of taking the exercise necessary to health
obliterated.&nbsp; Shoemakers and bootmakers suffer equally from
a constrained position and the pressure of the last against the
stomach.&nbsp; Heart-burn and indigestion are so common among
them, that a pill in the Pharmacopeia is called the
cobbler&rsquo;s pill.&nbsp; Then there is the baker&rsquo;s
malady, which carries off a large proportion of its
victims.&nbsp; Dressmakers are peculiarly subject to the attacks
of consumption; workwomen constantly suffer from varicose
veins.</p>
<p>There are two worlds in London, with a gulf between&mdash;the
rich and the poor.&nbsp; We have glanced at the latter; for the
sake of contrast let us look at the former.&nbsp; Emerson says
the wealth of London determines prices all over the globe.&nbsp;
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>The revenue of the corporation of the city of London for
1856 was &pound;2,595,216 16<i>s.</i> 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>&nbsp; In
1853 the money coined in the mint was &pound;11,952,391 in gold,
and &pound;701,544 in silver.&nbsp; The business of the Bank of
England is conducted by about 800 clerks, whose salaries amount
to about &pound;200,000.&nbsp; The Bank in 1857 had
&pound;26,683,790 bank notes in circulation.&nbsp; In the same
year there were about 5 millions deposited in the Savings Banks
of the metropolis.&nbsp; The gross Customs revenue of the port of
London in 1849 was &pound;11,070,176.&nbsp; 65 millions is the
estimate formed by Mr M&lsquo;Culloch of the total value of the
produce conveyed into and from London.&nbsp; The gross rental as
assessed by the property and income tax is 12&frac12;
millions.&nbsp; The gross property insured is &pound;166,000,000,
and only two-fifths of the houses are insured.&nbsp; The amount
of capital at the command of the entire London bankers may be
estimated at 64 millions; the insurance companies have always 10
millions of deposits ready for investment.&nbsp; 78 millions are
employed in discounts.&nbsp; In 1841 the transactions of one
London house amounted to 30 millions.&nbsp; In 1840 the payments
made in the clearing house were &pound;974,580,600,&mdash;an
enormous <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>sum, which will appear still greater
when we remember all sums under &pound;100 are omitted from this
statement.&nbsp; All this business cannot be carried on without a
considerable amount of eating and drinking.&nbsp; The population
consumes annually 277,000 bullocks, 30,000 calves, 1,480,000
sheep, 34,000 pigs, 1,600,000 quarters of wheat, 310,464,000
pounds of potatoes, 89,672,000 cabbages.&nbsp; Of fish the
returns are almost incredible.&nbsp; Besides, it eats 2,742,000
fowls, 1,281,000 game.&nbsp; Exclusive of those brought from the
different parts of the united kingdom, from 70 to 75 millions of
eggs are annually imported into London from France and other
countries.&nbsp; About 13,000 cows are kept in the city and its
environs for the supply of milk and cream; and if we add to their
value that of the cheese, and butter, and milk, brought from the
country into the city, the expenditure on dairy produce must be
enormous.&nbsp; Then London consumes 65,000 pipes of wine,
2,000,000 gallons of spirits, 43,200,000 gallons of porter and
ale, and burns 3,000,000 tons of coal; and I have seen it
estimated that one-fourth of the commerce of the nation is
carried on in its port.&nbsp; On Boxing Night it was estimated
that 60,000 persons visited the <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>various
theatres and places of amusement in London.&nbsp; In 1856,
361,714 persons visited the British Museum; 161,764, Hampton
Court; 344,140 went to Kew Gardens.&nbsp; The total number of
bathers in the Serpentine were 20,000 persons.&nbsp; On the last
Derby, the South Western Company alone conveyed 37,700
passengers.&nbsp; In London in 1853, according to Sir R. Mayne,
there were 3613 beer shops, 5279 public houses, 13 wine
rooms.&nbsp; The theatres and saloons licensed by the Lord
Chamberlain are, the Haymarket Theatre, Adelphi, Olympic,
Princess&rsquo;s, Strand, Surrey, Queen&rsquo;s, Soho, City of
London, Marylebone, Standard, Pavilion, Victoria, Sadler&rsquo;s
Wells, St James&rsquo;s, Lyceum, Astley&rsquo;s, Her
Majesty&rsquo;s, Drury Lane, Grecian Saloon, Albert, Britannia,
Bower, Earl of Effingham.&nbsp; Literary Institutions shut
up.&nbsp; The Great Globe itself is a doubtful property.&nbsp;
That beautiful building, the Panopticon in Leicester-square, was
a failure, and the Adelaide Gallery has long been closed.&nbsp;
An attempt was made to form an educational association in Charing
Cross, where, by means of a library and cheap lectures, the
popular mind could be improved and instructed and amused, but the
attempt did not succeed; dancing, drinking, <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>theatrical
representations,&mdash;most of them adaptations from the
French,&mdash;music, are the only pleasures which a London
population cared for.&nbsp; Even as in the old Hebrew days,
Wisdom lifts up her voice in our streets, and no man regards her
testimony.</p>
<p>And now to guard all this wealth, to preserve all this mass of
industry honest, and to keep down all this crime, what have
we?&nbsp; 5847 police, costing &pound;434,081, 13 police courts,
costing &pound;67,006, and about a dozen criminal prisons; 69
union relieving officers, 316 officers of local boards, and 1256
other local officers.&nbsp; We have 35 weekly magazines, 9 daily
newspapers, 5 evening, 72 weekly ones.&nbsp; Independently of the
mechanics&rsquo; institutions, colleges, and endowed schools, we
have 14,000 children of both sexes clothed and educated gratis,
and the National and British and Foreign Schools in all parts of
London, and Sunday schools.&nbsp; We have Bartholomew&rsquo;s
Hospital, relieving, in 1856, in-patients 5933, out-patients
78,443; Guy&rsquo;s Hospital; St Thomas&rsquo;s, with 4531
in-patients, outpatients, 34,281; St George&rsquo;s; the
Middlesex, last year relieving 2268 in-patients, and 16,844
out-patients; the London, the King&rsquo;s College, <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the
University College, and many more.&nbsp; In the Cancer Hospital
last year 2500 patients were treated: then there are Bedlam, the
Foundling Hospital, the Philanthropic Institution, the
Magdalen.&nbsp; In the report of the Statistical Society of
London it is stated that 14 general hospitals in London possess
an income from realised property to the amount of &pound;109,687;
annual subscriptions, &pound;17,091; donations, &pound;16,636;
legacies, &pound;10,206; and their miscellaneous sources of
income to &pound;1996.&nbsp; The total income of all these
hospitals from every source is &pound;155,616; and the annual
contributions of the public amount to &pound;45,929.&nbsp; In
addition to the above hospitals there are in this metropolis 36
special hospitals, possessing an aggregate income of
&pound;117,218; making the income of the general and special
hospitals taken together amount to &pound;272,834.&nbsp; There
are also returns from 42 general dispensaries, possessing incomes
from all sources of &pound;21,000; and 18 special dispensaries,
with annual incomes of &pound;8064.&nbsp; If these two sums,
making &pound;29,064, be added to the former, it gives the
enormous amount of &pound;301,898 annually expended in medical
charities in this metropolis; and this sum, <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>large as it
is, excludes Samaritan and other funds connected with hospitals
and dispensaries, poor-law medical relief (&pound;28,776), cost
of maintenance of pauper lunatics (&pound;79,988), vaccination
(&pound;4292), and nurses&rsquo; training institutions.&nbsp; All
these sums would make a grand total of nearly half a million
expended on our sick poor.&nbsp; The City Missionaries now number
325, and every missionary visits once a month about 500 families
or 2800 persons.&nbsp; The Ragged School Union has its
ramifications in every part of the metropolis.&nbsp; Their
returns are 128 Sunday Schools with 16,937 scholars in
attendance; 98 day ditto, with 13,057; 117 evening schools with
8085; and 84 industrial classes with 3224.&nbsp; London has 12
societies for the reformation of life and public morals with a
total income of &pound;11,583; 18 for reclaiming the fallen, and
staying the progress of crime, with &pound;35,036; 14 for the
relief of general destitution and distress, with &pound;23,880;
12 for the relief of specified distress, with &pound;29,881; 14
for aiding the resources of the industrious, with &pound;7246; 11
for the blind, deaf, and dumb, with &pound;34,762; 103 colleges,
hospitals, and other asylums for the aged (exclusive of Chelsea
and Greenwich Hospitals, <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&pound;83,047); 16 charitable pension societies, with
&pound;18,989; 74 charitable and provident societies, chiefly for
specified classes, with &pound;103,227; 31 asylums for orphans
and other necessitous children, with &pound;81,015; 10
educational foundations, exclusive of libraries, modern colleges,
or proprietary schools, &pound;93,112; 4 charitable ditto, with
&pound;13,300; 40 school societies, religious book,
church-aiding, and Christian instructing, irrespective of
government grants or establishments, with an income, taking the
sale of publications, as much as &pound;318,189.&nbsp; Mr Low
gives the total number of charitable institutions as 500; Mr
Mayhew puts down their number as 530.&nbsp; Then there are 100
temperance meetings held weekly.&nbsp; May we not hope that all
these institutions have some effect, that by means of them some
are reclaimed, and many saved?</p>
<p>The more direct religious agency may be estimated as
follows.&nbsp; In the Handbook to Places of Worship, published by
Low, in 1851, there is a list of 371 churches and chapels in
connexion with the Establishment; the number of church sittings,
according to Mr Mann, is 409,184; the Independents have about 140
places of worship and 100,436 sittings; the Baptists, 130 <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>chapels, and accommodation for 54,234; the Methodists,
154 chapels, 60,696; the Presbyterians, 23 chapels and 18,211
sittings; the Unitarians, 9 chapels and about 3300 sittings; the
Roman Catholics, 35 chapels and 35,994 sittings; 4 Quaker
chapels, with sittings for 3151; the Moravians have two chapels,
with 1100 sittings; the Jews have 11 synagogues and 3692
sittings.&nbsp; There are 94 chapels belonging to the New Church,
the Plymouth Brethren, the Irvingites, the Latter-Day Saints,
Sandemanians, Lutherans, French Protestants, Greeks, Germans,
Italians, which chapels have sittings for 18,833.&nbsp; We thus
get 691,723 attendants on divine exercises.</p>
<p>Those who know London life will know that I have not glanced
at its darkest side: any man of the world will tell you infamies
which I may not name here.&nbsp; I do not go so far as Mr
Patmore, and affirm that in the higher ranks of life a young man
is obliged to keep a mistress to avoid being laughed at; but I
can conceive of no city more sunk in licentiousness and rascality
than ours.&nbsp; Paris, Hamburgh, Vienna, may be as bad, but they
cannot be worse.&nbsp; The poor are looked after by the
police&mdash;visited by <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the city missionary; their wants and
woes are worked up into newspaper articles, and they live as it
were in houses of glass.&nbsp; It is true that one half the world
does not know how the other half lives; but it is not true in the
sense in which it is generally affirmed.&nbsp; Who ever has an
idea that a pious baronet, taking the chair at a religious
meeting in Exeter Hall, will prove a felon; that that house,
eminent in the mercantile and philanthropic world, will sanction
the circulation of forged Dock warrants; that that manager, about
to engage in prayer at a meeting of directors, will turn out to
be the manager of the greatest swindle of modern times?&nbsp; Who
sees a dishonoured suicide in the patriotic Sadleir, or in the
philanthropic Redpath a convict for life, or in the dashing
Robson a maniac?&nbsp; If I tell you that respectable old
gentleman now coming out of his club is going to inspect a fresh
victim, whom some procuress has lured with devilish art, you will
tell me that I am uncharitable; or if I point you to that
well-appointed equipage in the Park, and tell you that that fair
young girl that sits within has crushed many a young wife&rsquo;s
heart, and has sent many a man to the devil before his time, you
will tell me I exaggerate: <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>I do nothing
of the kind.&nbsp; If I were to tell what most men
know&mdash;what everyone knows, except those whose business it is
to know it, and to seek to reform it&mdash;I should be charged
with indelicacy, as if truth could be indelicate, and my book
perhaps suppressed by the Society for the Suppression of
Vice&mdash;if that abortion exists still.&nbsp; We are choked up
with cant; almost everything we believe in is a lie.&nbsp; The
prayer of Ajax should be ours,&mdash;Light&mdash;more light.</p>
<p>What are we to do?&mdash;to stand stock still, looking to
heaven &ldquo;with a frenzied air, as if to ask if a God were
there?&rdquo;&nbsp; One can almost believe, with George
Gilfillan, that the earth needs a new gospel and a new
manifestation of divine power.&nbsp; From this low estate who is
to rescue us?&nbsp; Not the aristocracy, a barbarous institution,
perpetrating barbarous ideas in our midst,&mdash;that work is not
honourable; whereas all true civilization points us to the fact,
that man is only happy and virtuous as he is steadily
industrious; and thus our most uncivilized classes are our upper
and lower,&mdash;our lords and ladies on one side, and our rogues
and prostitutes on the other.&nbsp; Not our law-makers, who
imprison our young lads in costly jails, <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>where the
criminals have luxuries denied to the poor; and then in Newgate,
or at the public works, mix them all up together, that the
comparatively innocent may learn to be adepts in crime.&nbsp; Not
our religious, I fear, when, from the Archbishop of Canterbury
down to Dr Cumming, the cry is, If you have a proper translation
of the Bible you will destroy the faith of the people.&nbsp; Not
our trading classes, becoming richer and more sunk in flunkeyism
every day.&nbsp; But it may be that these&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are graves from which a glorious phantom
may<br />
Burst to illumine our tempestuous day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whom am I to blame?&nbsp; Not the victims, but the fathers,
and mothers, and divines, and schoolmasters, and governing
classes.&nbsp; Father, you have given your bold, manly son an
emasculated religion,&mdash;a religion that wilfully shuts its
eyes, and will not look upon life as it is; and, immediately he
goes into the world, away vanish all the pasteboard defences with
which you childishly sought to guard him; and yet you will not
confess that in inculcating religious creeds,&mdash;that in
teaching children catechisms,&mdash;that in vaguely telling them
to be good,&mdash;that in leading them to believe in forms rather
than truths, <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>you are only damming up for a while
the passionate impulses of young blood, that they may ultimately
exert a more tumultuous and irresistible sway.&nbsp; You take the
little Arab of the streets, and, for acts of levity and
wantonness which all boys commit, you send him to prison, at an
age when you confess he is not a responsible creature, and then
idiotically wonder that he turns out a criminal, and that he wars
with society till he is hanged.&nbsp; You are surprised that
woman, fond of praise, of dress, and pleasure, should prefer to
walk the street in silk and satin, to have a short life and a
merry one, rather than slave and drudge, and end her days after
all in a workhouse.&nbsp; You tone down your fashionably educated
daughters into automatons, and then wonder that hot youth finds
domestic life tame and dull.&nbsp; Above all, do not go away with
the idea that we have reached the utmost height of
civilization,&mdash;that we are a model people,&mdash;that it is
our mission to set up as teachers of religion to all
mankind.&nbsp; Let us remember that the increase of crime and
dissipation are facts; that there can be no corrupter city than
London, and that it must be so, so long as we make professions
our practice so scandalously <!-- page 33--><a

I have heard Her Majesty&rsquo;s proclamation against vice and
immorality read at quarter-sessions by men in whose reading it
became a farce which the most ignorant bumpkin in court could
relish.&nbsp; Now we are going to do wonders, the policeman is to
supplement the parson, the wicked are to be hunted down.&nbsp; Is
this the way seriously to set about moral reform?&nbsp; Routine
and officialism in church and state have made the outside of the
sepulchre white enough; do we not need a little cleansing
within?&nbsp; How long will men look for grapes from thorns?</p>

34</span>SEEING A MAN HANGED.</h2>
<p>I am<span class="smcap"> </span>not about to give an opinion
as to the propriety or impropriety of capital punishments.&nbsp;
On this point good men have differed, and will differ, I dare
say, for some time to come.&nbsp; What I wish to impress upon the
philanthropic or Christian reader is the horrible nature and
atrocious effect of a public execution.</p>
<p>A few Sunday evenings since I was passing by Newgate, along
the outside of which a considerable crowd had been
collected.&nbsp; Respectable mechanics, with their wives and
children, were staring at its dreary stone walls.&nbsp; Ragged
boys and girls were romping and laughing in the streets.&nbsp;
All the neighbouring public-houses were filled with a tipsy
crowd.&nbsp; Here and there a few barriers had been erected, and
workmen were engaged in putting up more.&nbsp; Why were these
preparations made?&nbsp; For what purpose had this crowd
collected?&nbsp; A man was to be hung, was the reply.&nbsp; I
resolved for once to see the <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>tragedy
performed.&nbsp; To me or the living mass around, that man was an
utter stranger.&nbsp; I had never seen him or heard the sound of
his voice; all I knew was that he had led an outlaw&rsquo;s life,
and was to die as outlaws ofttimes do.&nbsp; How strange the
mysterious interest with which death clothes everything it
touches!&nbsp; Is it that looking at a man so soon to have done
with life we fancy we can better pry into the great secret?&nbsp;
Do we deem that seeing him struggle we shall die more manfully
ourselves, or is it merely the vague interest with which we
regard any one about to travel into distant regions, all unknown
to him or us, and the secrets of which he can never return to
tell?&nbsp; Be this as it may, I went back at twelve.&nbsp; The
public-houses had been closed, decent people had gone home to
bed; but already the crowd had become denser, already had the
thief and the bully from all the slums and stews of the
metropolis been collected together.&nbsp; You can easily
recognise the criminal population of our capital.&nbsp; The
policeman knows them instinctively, as with their small wiry
figures, restless eyes, and pale faces, they pass him by.&nbsp;
One can tell them as easily as one knows the child of Norman
origin by his noble <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>bearing, or the Anglo-Saxon by his
blue eyes and rosy cheeks.&nbsp; There is generally something
fine, and genial, and hearty about an English mob.&nbsp; On the
night of the peace-rejoicing you might have taken a lady from one
end of London to the other, and she would not have heard an
objectionable word, or been inconvenienced in the least; but the
mob of which I now write seemed utterly repulsive and reprobate;
all its sympathies seemed perverted.&nbsp; It is a hard world
this, I know, and it has but little mercy for the erring and the
unfortunate; but that they should regard it with such evil eyes,
that they should be so completely estranged from all its
recognised modes of thought and action, that it should seem to
them such a complete curse, was what I was not prepared to
expect.&nbsp; It really made one&rsquo;s blood run cold to hear
the mob around me talk.&nbsp; The man to be hung had rushed into
a jeweller&rsquo;s shop as it was being closed, beaten the
shopman, who tried to defend his master&rsquo;s property, with a
life-preserver, and then left him for dead.&nbsp; But he had not
said one word about his accomplices, and the crowd evidently
admired him rather than not.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ticket-of-leave man
was out on starvation,&rdquo; as <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>one of them
informed me.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Government,&rdquo; I drop the
expressive adjective by which the noun was prefixed,
&ldquo;dodges him, and if he steals it is only what he must do,
and if murder follows it is not his fault, and Government is
unjust in hanging him for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the popular
notion of the subject in my immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Government seemed to have planned the opportunity for the holders
of such opinions to ventilate them.&nbsp; Till eight
o&rsquo;clock these men were to be formed into one compact mass;
and how were they to pass their time if they did not talk? and
here who was there to lift up his voice on behalf of law and
order? and if there were such, who would have listened?&nbsp;
Realise the state of the case.&nbsp; Look around!&nbsp; Where do
you see the clear front and unabashed presence of honesty and
virtue?&nbsp; The virtuous and the honest have long been in
bed.&nbsp; Here there is a fight.&nbsp; That bundle of rags, with
matted hair covering all the face so that you cannot clearly see
a feature, is the Clare Market Pet, and she has just encountered
Slashing Sal, between whom and herself there has been mortal
enmity for years.&nbsp; Both women&mdash;yes, they are women, nor
so fallen are they but that the temperance <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>agent or the
city missionary may yet lead them to a diviner life, and
<i>He</i> may smile on them who never yet turned away repentant
son or daughter of sin and shame&mdash;are very tipsy, very
dirty, and very red.&nbsp; Shrieking and cursing, the Clare
Market Pet rushes on Slashing Sal, who is by no means loth for
the encounter.&nbsp; A ring is formed, men and boys halloo and
encourage, and the battle rages furiously, though both women are
far too drunk to do each other any serious harm.&nbsp; At length
the Clare Market Pet is vanquished and order is restored, just as
we are told tranquillity reigns at Naples.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please
give me a penny,&rdquo; says a girl of about fourteen, and I find
myself in the midst of a group of youthful costermongers and
their wives, who have come here for a lark, just as they frequent
the penny gaff, or crowd the gallery in the Victoria.&nbsp; I
listen to their slang till I feel sick, as I think for what a
future of crime and its result they are now rapidly
ripening.&nbsp; In this Christian land can no agency be formed
that shall save these young heathens?&nbsp; Again, I find a
female standing by my side; she is horridly dirty; she stinks of
gin; her face is that of the confirmed sot&mdash;of one who has
given up home and husband, <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and comfort,
and decency, for the accursed drink.&nbsp; She looks very
piteously in my face.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so they are going to hang
the poor man,&rdquo; she exclaims; &ldquo;they have no mercy on
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;the
poor man whom he murdered, and on whom he had no
mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she exclaims
with tipsy gravity; &ldquo;he had no right to kill the man, and
ought to be punished; but ain&rsquo;t we all morally
bad?&rdquo;&mdash;but here the conversation ends, for she has
sunk down, maudlin, stinking with gin, and overcome by it and
weariness, on the doorstep.&nbsp; Ah, these doorsteps, let us
look at them.&nbsp; To-night the police don&rsquo;t bid the
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i> move on.&nbsp; What crowds are collected
on them,&mdash;ragged boys, who, perhaps, have nowhere else to
sleep, wild-looking women unbonnetted and shoeless, with red,
uncombed hair, faces very much marked with the small pox, only
seen on such occasions as these&mdash;old men crouch on them for
whom home has no charm, and life no lustre, and girls whose
rouged cheeks and shabby finery tell to what wretchedness and
degradation, though young in years, they have already come.&nbsp;
Let them sleep on, if they can, on their stony mattress, beneath
this inclement sky, out in this cold December <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>night; they
are happier now than they can be in their waking hours!&nbsp; But
look at the windows, all lighted up and filled with gay
company.&nbsp; Those two beautiful girls&mdash;let us hope they
are not ladies&mdash;not English mothers or wives&mdash;who have
just stepped out of the brougham, and are now gazing from a
first-floor on the wild human sea beneath, will sit playing cards
and drinking champagne all night; yet scarce have the sounds of
Sabbath bells died away, and in a few hours a man is to be hung,
and these girls, all sensibility and tears, will sit with their
opera glasses during the fearful agony, as if merely Grisi acted
or Mario sang.</p>
<p>Let us take another stroll through this living mass.&nbsp; The
workmen have put up the last barriers&mdash;the clock strikes
three&mdash;a crowd, dense and eager, has planted itself by the
Old Bailey.&nbsp; The yard is thrown open, and three strong
horses, such as you see in brewers&rsquo; drays, drag along what
seems to be an immense clumsy black box.&nbsp; It stops at the
door of Newgate nearest to St Sepulchre&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Women
shriek as it rumbles over the stones, and you shudder, for
instinctively you guess it is the gallows.&nbsp; By the dim
gas-light you see workmen first fix securely a <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>stout
timber&mdash;then another&mdash;and then a beam across from which
hangs a chain&mdash;and now the crowd becomes denser.&nbsp; Let
us leave it and enter the house, at the top of which we have
previously engaged a seat.</p>
<p>We are some eight or nine in a very small room, and most of us
are amateurs in hanging, and it seems to us a very pleasant
show.&nbsp; Some of us have come a long way, and most of us have
been up all night.&nbsp; We have seen every execution for the
last ten years, and boast how on one day we saw one man hung at
Newgate, and took a cab and got to Horsemonger-lane in time to
see another.&nbsp; A rare feat that, and one of which we are
justly proud.&nbsp; We talk of these things, and how we have seen
criminals die, till some of us get very angry, and flatly
contradict each other.&nbsp; Altogether there is somewhat too
much mirth in the house, though we could not have had a better
place had we paid &pound;5 for it.&nbsp; The women are too
exuberant and full of fun.&nbsp; It is true, as the girls say to
each other, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t hang a man every day,&rdquo;
but the gaiety is discordant.&nbsp; Over the way <i>he</i> is
just waking up from his troubled sleep.&nbsp; A thin waif of
smoke goes up from the dark dreary building opposite&mdash;<!--
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>are they boiling him his last cup of tea?&nbsp; See,
there is a light in the press-room!&nbsp; Ah, what are they doing
there?&nbsp; St Sepulchre&rsquo;s strikes six.&nbsp; The door at
the foot of the scaffold opens, and very stealthily, and so as to
be seen by none but such as are high up like ourselves, a man
throws sawdust on the scaffold, and disappears again; we see him
this time with a chain or rope.&nbsp; All this while the
hydra-headed mob beneath amuses itself in various ways.&nbsp; It
sings songs, chiefly preferring those with a chorus&mdash;it
hoots dogs&mdash;it tosses small boys about on its top.&nbsp; As
we look from the window, we think we never saw such a mob
before.&nbsp; Far as the eye can reach towards Ludgate-hill on
one side, and Giltspur-street on the other, it is one mass of
human heads; the very air is tainted with their odour&mdash;we
smell it where we are.&nbsp; Our amateur friends are in excellent
spirits; they have not seen so many people at an execution for
some years.&nbsp; They are agreeably surprised; they all thought
the man would not have been hung, and had backed their opinions
by bets.</p>
<p>A long wearisome night was it, even to us&mdash;and it is not
yet eight.&nbsp; The roar of the crowd is so great&mdash;can
<i>he</i> hear it within?&mdash;that we <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>cannot catch
the sound of the neighbouring chimes; but we see signs that the
end is approaching.&nbsp; The police have filled up the
intervening space between the scaffold and the crowd.&nbsp; A
bell tinkles dismally, horridly.&nbsp; We look beyond the
scaffold down into the open doorway, and there they are,
ascending the stairs.&nbsp; First the chaplain, then the
criminal, and then Jack Ketch.&nbsp; Marley walks steadily, with
pale face and eyes cast down, and places himself immediately
under the rope.&nbsp; He trembles slightly as his legs are being
fastened, his hands had already been pinioned behind.&nbsp; A
nightcap is drawn over his face, the rope is adjusted round his
neck, Jack Ketch hastens down the ladder, the chaplain, reading
the burial service all the while, steps back, down goes the drop,
a woman or two shrieks, there is a slight convulsive movement of
the body, and what was a minute back a living man is now a
dishonoured corpse.&nbsp; There he dangles in the cold north wind
for an hour.&nbsp; We cannot get away, as the crowd is determined
to see the last of it, and will not move.&nbsp; It stops to hoot
Jack Ketch, as he comes to cut Marley down at nine
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Till then, there he hangs, a tall, well-made
man, with fine dark whiskers, <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>in his very
prime, heedless of the sixty thousand glaring eyes all round,
with hands clasped as if supplicating that divine mercy which all
born of woman need, and which may God grant us in our dying
hour.&nbsp; Away hastes the crowd to its business or its
pleasure; and when a short time after I pass by the very spot
where that hideous throng had stood, blaspheming in the very
presence of death, butchers&rsquo; and carriers&rsquo; carts
filled up the vacant space, and the past night seemed a ghastly
dream.</p>
<h2><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>CATHERINE-STREET.</h2>
<p>Strand, is a busy place by day-time (it does a great business
in the newspaper line, and about four or five in the afternoon it
is used by the acute newsboys of the metropolis as a kind of
Change), but it is busier far by night, and the later the hour
the more active and lively it grows.&nbsp; As you walk along the
Strand any time in the afternoon and evening, have you not seen
(to our shame be it said) a sight not visible in the chief
thoroughfare of any other capital in Europe?&nbsp; The sight I
allude to is that of girls, whose profession is but too evident
from their appearance, stopping almost every man they meet,
mildly, perhaps, in the early part of the evening&mdash;but,
under the influence of drink, with greater rudeness and freedom
as the night wears on.&nbsp; These girls, as you observe, are
dressed in finery hired for the purpose; and following them, as a
hawk its prey, you will perceive at a respectful distance old
hags, always Jewesses, <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>whose business it is to see that
these girls do not escape with their fine dresses, and that they
are active in their efforts to entrap young men void of
understanding.&nbsp; Well, these women all live in the
neighbourhood of Catherine-street.&nbsp; What a filthy trade the
Jews and Jewesses of London drive!&nbsp; You may go into
Elysiums, and wine-rooms, and saloons, in this district, and you
will find them belonging to Jews&mdash;the waiters Jews&mdash;the
wine, the women, the cigars, all in the hands of Jews&mdash;true
to their ancient vocation of &ldquo;spoiling the
Egyptians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me not be understood as joining in
vulgar prejudices against the Jews.&nbsp; Without reading
&ldquo;Coningsby,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord George Bentinck, a
Political Biography,&rdquo; I am ready to confess that there have
been, and still are, great and gifted men born to the Jewish
race; but I am speaking of the vile crew who earn an infamous
livelihood by pandering to all that is degraded in man or
woman&mdash;whose vulture eyes follow you up and down
Catherine-street, and who, if they could, would rob you of your
last farthing, and tear off from your back its last rag, and who
by fair means or foul rear up prostitutes, and trade in flesh and
blood.&nbsp; But pardon the digression, and yet not exactly <!--
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>is the subject a digression, when we remember
Catherine-street and its neighbouring courts would be a very
different locality, had not the Jews selected it as a fitting
place for operation.&nbsp; In the days Consule Planco, as Mr
Thackeray would write, in the hot youth of the Regency, before
George IV. had become prematurely used up, and a moral people had
erected a statue to the memory of the most dissolute king in
Christendom as a lesson for England&rsquo;s ingenuous youth and
as an example for future royal princes, Catherine-street was gay
indeed, if wine and profligacy in the lowest and worst reality of
forms are ever gay.&nbsp; There was Mother H.&rsquo;s, where
bucks assembled, and reckless women danced and drank for a few
short years ere they died wretchedly in parish poor-houses, or
sought oblivion and repose in the dark waters of the neighbouring
Thames.&nbsp; Up and down Catherine-street what wretchedness
masked in smiles has walked&mdash;what sin in satin&mdash;what
devilish craft and brutal lust, aye, and, what is worse than all,
what unavailing repentance and regret!</p>
<p>A very fleeting population is that of Catherine-street.&nbsp;
These women, commencing their life at eighteen, are few of them
supposed to last more <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>than eight years; and if you see them
in the day-time, before they are painted and dressed
up&mdash;with their red eyes and bloated faces, you will think
few of them will last even that short time; but they pass on one
by one to the spirit land, not as did Antigone, conscious of duty
done, though wailing her unwedded state, nor as Jephthah&rsquo;s
high-souled daughter, for whom Hebrew maidens devoutly
wept&mdash;but with body and soul alike loathsome and steeped in
sin.&nbsp; Here in Catherine-street vice is a monster of a
hideous mien.&nbsp; The gay women, as they are termed, are worse
off than American slaves, and the men at the best are but drunken
fools frittering away time and money and health, and rooting out
from their hearts all trace of the divine that may be yet
lingering there.&nbsp; The West is the more fashionable quarter,
and the glory of Catherine-street is fled.&nbsp; Almost every
house you come to is a public-house, or something worse.&nbsp;
Here there is a free-and-easy after the theatres are over; there
a lounge open all night for the entertainment of bullies and
prostitutes, and pickpockets and thieves, greenhorns from the
country or London-born; here a dancing saloon, which we are told
in the advertisement no visitor <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>should leave
London without first seeing, and there a coffee-house where, when
expelled from gayer places of resort, half intoxicated men and
women take an early breakfast.&nbsp; All round you are bitter
memories.&nbsp; Every stone you tread is red with blood; you can
almost hear the last dying shriek of virtue, before, by means of
the tempting purse or the hocussed draught, the poor
victim&mdash;feebler in her struggles every hour&mdash;be lost
for ever.&nbsp; Yet the gas burns brightly by night, and there is
dancing, and wine, and songs, and in the small hours you may hear
a hollow laughter, sadder even than cries and tears.&nbsp; Think
what years and years of tedious culture must have elapsed to
produce this concentrated essence of vice.&nbsp; How many must
have died in the seasoning&mdash;how many must have turned back
shuddering as they saw the dark ending to their infatuated
career&mdash;how many weeping parents must have won back to
decency and the observance of moral and social law&mdash;how many
the want of pecuniary means must have compelled into a reluctant
abstinence!&nbsp; Such a crop could only be reared in such a
Sodom and Gomorrha as ours.&nbsp; That landlord, gloating over
his ill-gotten gains, could not have sunk into so fallen <!--
page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>a condition rapidly.&nbsp; It has taken years to make
him what he is.&nbsp; There is no excuse for him, and he knows
it.&nbsp; It is not for the honest refreshment of the weary or
the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> accommodation of the public that his
house is open.&nbsp; The real public have been in bed for
hours.&nbsp; These men around us are here for immoral
purposes.&nbsp; These women are on the same bad errand, and that
they may better pursue their vocation, here they come and drink;
but he sells his poison, thinking not of the mischief it will do,
but of the gain it will bring.&nbsp; Is he not a degraded man,
with his double chin, and dirty face, and low forehead? can you
see in him one trace of benevolence or humanity?&nbsp; Do you
doubt this?&mdash;spend your last farthing in his bar, pawn every
article of clothing you have, and go with an empty pocket and in
rags, and you will soon be ordered to the door.&nbsp; You see he
is now turning out that wretched creature.&nbsp; He has allowed
her to drink till she has no more money; but she solicited chance
customers, and they treated her to gin, and so the landlord let
her stop; but now she is so drunk as to interfere with his
business, and he turns her houseless and friendless out into the
streets.&nbsp; Let us watch her.&nbsp; She <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>is too far
gone to have any decency left.&nbsp; Drink and sadness combined
have tortured her brain to madness.&nbsp; Her curses fill the
air; a crowd collects; the police come up; she is borne on a
stretcher to Bow-street, and in the morning is dismissed with a
reprimand, or sentenced to a month&rsquo;s imprisonment, as the
sitting magistrate is in a good temper or the reverse.&nbsp; The
longer we stop here the more of such scenes shall we see, for
with such publicans and sinners Catherine-street abounds.&nbsp; I
have known life lost here in these midnight brawls; yet by day it
has a dull and decent appearance, and little would the passing
stranger guess all its revelations of sorrow and of crime.</p>

52</span>THE BAL MASQUE,</h2>
<p>In<span class="smcap"> </span>foreign lands, we are told, is
something refined and delicate.&nbsp; I have been to some abroad
which certainly were nothing of the kind; but in England, or
rather in London, they are low, blackguard places, whether in the
Holborn Casino, or Covent Garden, or the Grecian Saloon, or
Vauxhall, or at Drury-lane.&nbsp; In 1723 they were put down by
government.&nbsp; Steele wrote of them, that in his time,
&ldquo;the misfortune of the thing is, that people dress
themselves in what they have a mind to be&mdash;and not what they
are fit for.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have seen the French men and women at
Vauxhall, and if they do in Paris what they do there&mdash;why,
then I doubt somewhat of the superiority even of French Bal
Masqu&eacute;s.&nbsp; But in England a public Bal Masqu&eacute;
is a disgusting exhibition, to enjoy which every moral sense must
be deadened, and then a man must be drunk and have his pockets
well lined.&nbsp; The rustic flower-girls and simple hay-makers
with <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>whom you dance will drink champagne as if it were
ginger-beer, and consume all the delicacies of the season as if
they cost no more than bacon and beans.</p>
<p>The fun, as it is termed, generally commences about 11 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>, by an immense mob of costermongers,
tag-rag and bob-tail, forming themselves in a row under the
<i>surveillance</i> of the police, to watch and criticise the
appearance of the maskers, and specially to regale themselves
with jokes should any unfortunate do the economical and arrive on
foot.&nbsp; I hear people say they like London&mdash;they can do
anything they like without being observed.&nbsp; I doubt that
much.&nbsp; I advise the strong-minded female who tells me that,
to walk down Cheapside in a Bloomer costume, and I will warrant
she will have as great a mob accompanying her as followed Kossuth
or any other hero to Guildhall.&nbsp; But to return to the Bal
Masqu&eacute;.&nbsp; I presume the company are arriving and the
little boys are cheering, as only little boys can, right under
cab wheels and in between the horses&rsquo; legs.&nbsp; Some of
the company, to borrow an ancient witticism, go disguised as
gentlemen&mdash;some buy a mask at the door for
fourpence&mdash;others delight in monstrous noses <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and
fearful moustache&mdash;others, especially those who have fancy
dresses, appear as Charles II.s, Cardinal Wolseys, Shakspeares,
Henry VIII.s, Scotch Highlanders, Australian Diggers, Monks, and
look far better when they enter than they do when they make their
exit in the early light of a summer morning.&nbsp; The same
remark holds true of their female companions, who are mostly the
same ladies that you meet in Regent-street in the afternoon, or
hanging about the Hay-market all night, a class at no time
remarkable for modesty, but whom we shall see in the course of
the evening becoming bold and brazenfaced with excitement and
wine.&nbsp; But the theatre is full&mdash;the guests are
met&mdash;the band is assembled&mdash;the leader wields the
baton&mdash;the sparkling chandeliers give a lustre to the scene,
and away they bound to the music, whilst from the boxes and the
gallery admiring crowds look down.&nbsp; Yes, there is a wild
excitement in the hour, which stirs even the pulses of old
blood.&nbsp; The women, as debardeurs, flower girls, sailor
boys&mdash;many of them with faces fitting them for diviner
lives, look beautiful even in their degradation and shame.&nbsp;
Horace tells us, wherever we go black care gets up and rides
behind.&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp; <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Can there be
sad hearts beneath those gay exteriors?&nbsp; Do those cheeks
flushed and radiant eyes indicate that they belong to those whom
all moralists have held infamous, all religions condemned, and
whose existence our modern civilization perpetuates and
deplores?&nbsp; Is man an immortal being, sent here for awhile to
triumph over fleshly lusts and passions, to learn to trample as
dross on the vanities of earth, and to set his affections on
things above?&nbsp; Is it true that the most successful votaries
of pleasure, from kingly Solomon to lordly Byron, have borne the
same testimony to them, that they are not worth the gathering,
that they are but as apples gathered by the shore of the Dead
Sea, fair to the eye but deadly to the taste, and that in no way
can they answer the need and aspirations of the heart of man,
which is greater and grander than them all?&nbsp; Have we paid
ministers of religion, bishops and archbishops, millions and
millions of pounds to teach men these few self-evident truths,
and yet do such orgies as those of which we write not merely
exist but flourish, as if we had accepted the creed of the
Atheist,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us eat and drink and be merry, for
to-morrow we die&rdquo;?&nbsp; To-morrow! who around us now
thinks <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of to-morrow?&nbsp; Not the young
rake chaffing and dancing before us, whose mirth is the delirium
of forgetfulness and the intoxication of wine, whose to-morrow is
Whitecross-street Prison or the Insolvent Debtors&rsquo;
Court.&nbsp; Not that brazenfaced woman now arrayed in splendour,
and surrounded by her admirers, whose to-morrow is old age,
neglect, and a garret.&nbsp; Not those grey-headed gouty old
sinners in the boxes, who have not the excuse of youth for the
follies with which they desecrate old age.&nbsp; And certainly
not that pale clerk, who has most probably embezzled his
employer&rsquo;s money, and who is frantically exclaiming,
&ldquo;Waiter, another bottle of champagne,&rdquo; as he tells
the women of his lot that he feels &ldquo;a cup too
low.&rdquo;&nbsp; You say he has them to cheer him.&nbsp; Yes,
till his money is gone.&nbsp; When he is at Bow-street, as
assuredly he will soon be, I promise you they will not be the
last to give evidence as to his possession of funds, or the
manner of his spending them.&nbsp; There may be honour among
thieves, there is none among women when they have once lost their
own.</p>
<p>Still gaily goes on the dancing.&nbsp; Then there is supper
and wine&mdash;and more dancing, and more music, and more
wine.&nbsp; The reporters for <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the papers
generally leave about supper-time, and state that the gaieties
were prolonged till a late hour; it is well they do this.&nbsp;
In the earlier part of the evening the rioting and chaffing is
somewhat of the coarsest, and the wit somewhat of the poorest;
and the later it grows, and the more potent is the vinous
influence, the less select, or rather the more obscene, is the
phraseology.&nbsp; In the wild saturnalia that ensues, all the
restraints of decency and habit are thrown on one side.&nbsp; It
is time to close, and the conductor sees this.&nbsp; Already
Henry VIII. is right royally drunk, and Cardinal Wolsey is
uttering flat blasphemy, and one monk has got a black eye,
another a bloody nose.&nbsp; Unless, as in the case of Covent
Garden, the theatre is burned down, and the proceedings are
abruptly terminated, there is a final dance,&mdash;a patriotic
rendering of the national anthem,&mdash;and into the air walk, or
rather tumble, the debauchees, some to go home quietly to bed,
others to keep it up in the nearest coffee-houses and
public-houses; and handmaidens rising early to take in the milk
in various parts of the metropolis are astonished by the
exceedingly unsteady gait and singular costumes <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>of various
dismal gents, who have, if they are not absolute fools, sworn
that it will be a long time before they go to another
masqu&eacute; bal.&nbsp; Such, I believe, is the general
conclusion, the only exceptions being the costumier who provides
the dresses, generally a Jew, and the bigger Jew who furnishes
the wine.</p>

59</span>UP THE HAYMARKET.</h2>
<p>If I take up the reports of our various religious societies, I
find we are spending an enormous sum in sending the Gospel into
foreign parts.&nbsp; I<span class="smcap"> </span>don&rsquo;t say
but what this is praiseworthy&mdash;Indians, Turks, Jews,
Assyrians, bond and free, are they not all children of one common
Father with ourselves?&mdash;but let us not overlook after all
the claims of home.&nbsp; I do not speak now of the lowest
classes, of the refuse and outcasts of our towns, of the Pariahs
of our civilization; I speak of the heathens in satin and
broadcloth, of the vice that wears patent leather boots and the
best French kid, of the intemperance that feasts at rich
men&rsquo;s tables, and that is born of hock, and claret, and
champagne.</p>
<p>But what has all this to do with the Haymarket?&nbsp; Wait
awhile, and your curiosity will be satisfied.&nbsp; It is
day-time, and we will stroll up thither.&nbsp; There is nothing
peculiar about the place, except the unusual number of
gin-palaces, <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>hotels, French restaurants,
oyster-shops, coffee-houses with the blinds drawn, as if to show
they did not care to do business, and the general sleepy
appearance of the waiters.&nbsp; There is a cab-stand seemingly
inclined to shut up shop, and if it were not for the omnibuses
there would be but few indications of life.&nbsp; On the
right-hand side as you go from Pall Mall there are most
respectable shops, but the wonder to me is how they manage to
attract custom sufficient to enable them to pay what must be
their very heavy rents.&nbsp; At the top of the Haymarket we find
the street from Leicester-square to Piccadilly always full of
traffic, and just opposite are the oyster-shops, and Turkish
divans and caf&eacute;s, all quiet enough now, but at the
witching hour of night destined to be filled to suffocation with
fast men and flash women, with cabs and carriages, with old hags
with fruit and flowers, male vendors of pencils and knives,
policemen and bullies, fools and rogues.&nbsp; Let us skip over a
short interval of time, and suppose the neighbouring church bells
to have chimed the midnight hour.&nbsp; A few steps take us to
the Lowther Arcade.&nbsp; We take our stand with a crowd just
opposite a building with an entrance lighted with gas, which we
learn to <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>be a handsome casino&mdash;one of the
handsomest in London&mdash;devoted to dancing and drinking.&nbsp;
The hour of closing has arrived, and the votaries of pleasure, as
it is called, are leaving.&nbsp; There are an immense number of
women all splendidly dressed&mdash;from the young girl who has
not yet learnt the bitterness of the life she has ventured on, to
the woman thoroughly dead to all feeling, all modesty, and
shame.&nbsp; It is a sad sight, though few see the snake in the
grass for the flowers; and of the gay ones there none think they
will ever become like the bloated, ragged women now standing in
their path and asking with the true professional whine for
alms.&nbsp; Some are borne away in broughams, some in cabs, but
the most on foot.&nbsp; Let us now look at the men.&nbsp; You
cannot see a finer set anywhere.&nbsp; Are not the flower of our
youth and manhood there?&nbsp; Of course I refer merely to their
physical formation.&nbsp; Young fellows from the army and navy,
men from all our universities and inns of court, gents from the
city and the Stock Exchange, and respectable middle-aged country
gentlemen stopping in town a night, and just dropping in to see
what is going on.&nbsp; Before us there is enough material to
found a mighty empire, including even that <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>pale
melancholy little lordling dashing along in his cab, who has
already, boy as he is, a regiment; and all this multitude is
going headlong to the devil at express speed, in spite of the
baptismal vow and the ministrations of the church.&nbsp; But let
us see what they are about.&nbsp; Here a portion seeks supper at
the neighbouring oyster-rooms, and a rush is made at the waiters
as they bring in oysters and pale ale, as if the parties had been
famishing all day.&nbsp; Then we knock at the door of a place at
one time much patronized by a certain marquis, and still bearing
his name; and we find some that we saw leaving the casino here
drinking; or we go into another, where the crowd is so dense we
have scarce room to stand, and find the same occupation
vigorously carried on.&nbsp; Of course at the places which do not
have closed doors the bars are all filled, and drinking seems the
order of the night.&nbsp; In the mean while let us march up
Piccadilly.&nbsp; The small hours have now come, yet the place is
redolent with life.&nbsp; Young fellows are singing &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t go home till morning&rdquo;&mdash;policemen are
bidding the unfortunates that won&rsquo;t fee them move
on&mdash;hideous females are waiting to rob the drunkards they
may meet in their path&mdash;and men with <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>hawk eyes and
hungry aspect are hovering all round like so many birds of prey;
and boys&mdash;for they are everywhere, all dirt and rags, yet
happy in the richness of young life, for childhood, even the most
abandoned, can never be sad&mdash;dance round us, in the hope
that &ldquo;your honour&rdquo; will find a copper for &ldquo;poor
little Jack,&rdquo; singing to us of that far-famed
Ratcatcher&rsquo;s Daughter, who</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t live in Vestministere,<br />
But the t&rsquo;other side of the vatere.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d rather be one of them than the proprietress of
yon house, with the gas lamp over the door, who by this time has
been borne by the Great Northern in a first-class carriage, side
by side with senators, and city magistrates, and clergymen, and
it may be your wife or mine, to her country seat.&nbsp; We are
standing in the very temple of vice&mdash;its ministers are all
round us.&nbsp; Not one unholy appetite but can be gratified
here; gamblers, blacklegs, prostitutes, surround us on every
side.&nbsp; Here law, and order, and decency are alike all
violated.&nbsp; If it be in the prohibited hours, we can go into
coffee-houses and get as much brandy as we like, which of course
is easily removed when the signal is made that <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the inspector
is coming, and is again brought out when he is gone.&nbsp; But
let us knock at this door; the glare of gas indicates that there
is something going on, though the cold fowl in the window, and
the cigar shop close by, scarcely inform us what.&nbsp; We pay
for admission, and, entering through a narrow passage, find
ourselves in a large saloon, with a balcony all round.&nbsp; On
the ground-floor of course there is dancing, and at the end is a
bar where drink is being rapidly supplied.&nbsp; Up in the
balcony are young fellows sitting with gaily-dressed women,
drinking sherry-cobblers and smoking cigars.&nbsp; In time the
room gets crowded, and the people in it grow a little the worse
for drink.&nbsp; Though we can scarce see for the smoke, and hear
on account of the roar of many tongues, it is not difficult to
perceive in the hilariousness of some, in the bad temper of
others, in the stupidity of most, and in the foul language of
all, that the drink is producing its legitimate effect.&nbsp;
That girl in satin and rouge in another hour we shall see lying
on the stone pavement with an unmeaning grin, till she is borne
by policemen on a stretcher to the lock-up.&nbsp; That fine manly
lad, out to see life, will sleep to-night where the <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>mother now praying for him in her dreams little
imagines.&nbsp; <i>She</i> would not have sunk so low, <i>he</i>
never would have blasted a mother&rsquo;s hopes, had it not have
been for the drink.&nbsp; Come out with me into the air.&nbsp;
What a crowd there is round us, all looking pale and seedy in the
clear light of a summer morn!&nbsp; What has kept them out all
night?&nbsp; What has made them what they are but the
drink?&nbsp; You start at that moving mass of sores and
rags.&nbsp; I remember her fair and beautiful, richly apparelled
and sumptuously fed; but the drink has been her bane, and will
be, till one of these calm summer mornings she will be carried
insensible to the nearest hospital, thence to be buried, unwept
and unknown, in a pauper&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; Away from this
moral dunghill.&nbsp; In a few hours the police will have
retired, the debauchees will have gone home to bed, the
oyster-houses and gin-palaces will be deserted, the place will
have a serious and quiet business air, and bishops will ride past
it in their cushioned carriages to make speeches at meetings for
the promotion of the Gospel in foreign parts.&nbsp; As we go up
Regent-street we see the lamps being extinguished, and the milk
carts going round, and the red newspaper expresses tearing <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>along to catch the early train, and the green hills of
Hampstead looking lovelier than ever.&nbsp; In the sober light of
day our night in the Haymarket will seem unreal, and when we
shall tell our experiences, we shall be told possibly that our
picture is overdrawn.</p>

67</span>THE CANTERBURY HALL.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Give<span class="smcap"> </span>me the songs of the
people, and you may make its laws,&rdquo; said old Fletcher, of
Saltoun, with a knowledge of human nature which statesmen do not
frequently possess.&nbsp; Necessity is a stern taskmaster, and
the workman in the factory, and the clerk in the counting-house,
and the shopman behind the counter, are generally compelled to
stick pretty close to work, and to the eye of the observer
present very much the same appearance.&nbsp; They come at certain
hours, they go at certain hours, and perform their daily toil
with a certain amount of effectiveness and skill.&nbsp; Very
little credit is due to them for this&mdash;their livelihood
depends upon their being diligent and active&mdash;and hence I
know little of the individual by merely witnessing him toiling
for his daily bread.&nbsp; I must follow him home; I must be with
him in his hours of relaxation; I must listen to the songs he
sings and the jokes he attempts; I must see what is his idea of
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>pleasure, and thus only can I get at the man as he
is.&nbsp; Even his church or chapel goings I cannot take as
indications of his real nature.&nbsp; He may go because his
parents go, because his master goes, because his friends go,
because he has been trained to go, because society expects him to
go,&mdash;for a hundred reasons all equally vain in the eyes of
Him who searcheth the heart and trieth the reins of the children
of men; but no man is a hypocrite where his pleasures are
concerned.&nbsp; I can gather more about him from the way in
which he spends his leisure hours than I can from his active
employments of the day.&nbsp; They are poor miserable
philosophers indeed, and guilty of an enormous blunder, who, in
their investigation into the moral and social condition of the
people, refuse to notice the amusements of the people in their
hours of gaiety and ease.&nbsp; I make, then, no apology for
introducing you to Canterbury Hall.</p>
<p>The Upper Marsh, Westminster-road, is what is called a low
neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is not far from Astley&rsquo;s
Theatre.&nbsp; Right through it runs the South Western Railway,
and everywhere about it are planted pawnbrokers&rsquo; shops,
with an indescribable amount of dirty second-hand <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>clothes, and monster gin-palaces, with unlimited
plate-glass and gas.&nbsp; Go along there what hour of the day
you will, these gin-palaces are full of ragged children, hideous
old women, and drunken men.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bane and the
antidote,&rdquo; you may say, &ldquo;are thus side by
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, but you forget that youth in its search
for pleasure is blind, and sees not the warning till it is too
late; and of the hundreds rushing on to the Canterbury Hall for a
quiet glass, none think they will fall so low as the victims of
intemperance reeling, cursing, fighting, blaspheming, in their
path.&nbsp; But let us pass on.&nbsp; A well-lighted entrance
attached to a public-house indicates that we have reached our
destination.&nbsp; We proceed up a few stairs, along a passage
lined with handsome engravings, to a bar, where we pay sixpence
if we take a seat in the body of the hall, and nine-pence if we
do the nobby and ascend into the balcony.&nbsp; We make our way
leisurely along the floor of the building, which is really a very
handsome hall, well lighted, and capable of holding fifteen
hundred persons; the balcony extends round the room in the form
of a horseshoe.&nbsp; At the opposite end to which we enter is
the platform, on which is placed a grand piano <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and a
harmonium, on which the performers play in the intervals when the
professional singers have left the stage.&nbsp; The chairman sits
just beneath them.&nbsp; It is dull work to him; but there he
must sit every night smoking cigars and drinking, from seven till
twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I fancy I detect a little touch of
rouge just on the top of his cheek; he may well need it, for even
on a fine summer night like this the room is crowded, and almost
every gentleman present has a pipe or a cigar in his mouth.&nbsp;
Let us look round us; evidently the majority present are
respectable mechanics, or small tradesmen with their wives and
daughters and sweethearts there.&nbsp; Now and then you see a
midshipman, or a few fast clerks and warehousemen, who
confidentially inform each other that there is &ldquo;no end of
talent here,&rdquo; and that Miss --- &ldquo;is a doosed fine
gal;&rdquo; and here, as elsewhere, we see a few of the class of
unfortunates, whose staring eyes would fain extort an admiration
which their persons do not justify.&nbsp; Every one is smoking,
and every one has a glass before him; but the class that come
here are economical, and chiefly confine themselves to pipes and
porter.&nbsp; The presence of the ladies has also a beneficial
effect; I see no indication <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>of
intoxication, and certainly none of the songs are obscene.&nbsp;
I may question the worth of such stanzas as the following, sung
by Mr R. Grover, Miss Pearce, and the whole of the
company:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Alfred</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll drink to the beauty that&rsquo;s
beaming around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Nature&rsquo;s own flowers
are blooming;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where none but the voices of happiness sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our pathway the love-light
illumes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
drink, too, to the rosy god,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The god of love and beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all who are
his vot&rsquo;ries<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Must tender him their duty.<br />
We&rsquo;ll drink while there&rsquo;s love in the cup which we
quaff,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since&rsquo;t is love o&rsquo;er the world reigns
supreme.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Chorus</span>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll drink to friendship firm and true,<br />
While love the cup shall crown.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Violetta</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, bask in the pleasure that falls to our
share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Time on the wing&rsquo;s ever
flying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flowers of love are exotics so rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their odour&rsquo;s scarce shed
ere &rsquo;t is flown.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be gay, for
youth must soon depart,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And even love will vanish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brightest
scenes, alas! will fade,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sweetest pleasures pall.<br />
Be gay, then, while youth still untrammell&rsquo;d by care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall invite us to joy and to love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span><span
class="smcap">Chorus</span>.</p>
<p>Ah! let us join in the toast,<br />
In the song and the revelling,<br />
Passing the night in mirthful pleasure,<br />
While love shall teach us how to treasure<br />
This paradise on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may think I have heard sublimer compositions than the
following, sung by Mrs Caulfield with great applause:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Fare you well, my own Mary Anne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fare you well for a while:<br />
For the ship it is ready, and the wind it is fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am bound for the sea, Mary Anne.<br />

74</span>But, compared with many of the places frequented by both
sexes, Canterbury Hall is a respectable place.&nbsp; I may think
that more rational amusement might be found than by sitting
smoking and drinking in a large room on a hot summer&rsquo;s
night.&nbsp; I may have my doubts whether all go home
sober&mdash;the presence of a policeman in the room indicated
that at times there was need for his services&mdash;but I believe
the association of song and drinking and amusements pernicious in
the extreme; and, knowing that man needs relaxation&mdash;that he
must have his hour of amusement as well as of work&mdash;I cannot
too earnestly press upon the advocates of Temperance reform the
desirableness of their out-bidding the public-house in the
attempts to cater for the entertainment of the people.&nbsp; That
they do not do so, is clear.&nbsp; Where once we had a National
Hall in Holborn, for the action of moral influences, a publican
has erected a hall&mdash;for singing and drinking&mdash;capable,
I should think, of holding 1200 people, and crammed every
night.&nbsp; Then the &ldquo;Lord Raglan&rdquo; holds as
many.&nbsp; Nor are these alone the only competitors for public
patronage; their name is Legion.</p>

<p>London<span class="smcap"> </span>is several cities rolled
into one.&nbsp; If we walk along Regent-street, it is a city of
gorgeous shops,&mdash;if you turn into the West, of parks and
palaces,&mdash;if you traverse St Giles, of gin and
dirt;&mdash;again, in Belgravia it is rich and grand,&mdash;in
Pimlico it is poor and pretentious,&mdash;in Russell-square it is
well to do,&mdash;in Islington it is plain and pious; and,
strange as it may seem, the people are equally localised in their
ideas.&nbsp; Jobson, the Stock-broker, lives at Clapham, and for
years he has never set foot in any other streets than those
leading from the Stock Exchange to that select and favoured
spot.&nbsp; The law clerks, who live in Pimlico, seldom stray
further than John-street, Bedford-row.&nbsp; The city gents from
Islington and Holloway generally cluster round the Bank or the
Post-office, and for years go in the morning and return at night
by one unvaried route.&nbsp; The races are equally
distinct.&nbsp; The swells in the Park, the millers in <!-- page

<p>I should not like a son of mine to be born and bred in
Ratcliffe-highway.&nbsp; That there would be a charming
independence in his character, a spurning of that dreary
conventionalism which makes cowards of us all, and under the
deadly weight of which the heart of this great old England seems
becoming daily more sick and sad, a cosmopolitanism rich and racy
in the extreme,&mdash;all this I admit I should have every reason
to expect, but, at the same time, I believe the disadvantages
would preponderate vastly.&nbsp; How is this? you ask.&nbsp; Does
not Ratcliffe-highway form part of our highly-favoured
land?&nbsp; I grant it does.&nbsp; I confess that there the
Queen&rsquo;s writ is a power, that it boasts the protection of
the police, that it pays rates and taxes, that it has <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>its
churches and chapels, that it is not cut off from the rest of the
empire, that it is traversed by railways, by cabs and busses, and
by postmen.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Ratcliffe-highway is not a
favourite spot of mine.&nbsp; I saw lately a letter from an
Englishman in the <i>Times</i>, complaining of the magistrates of
Hamburg, because when he was coming from church with some ladies,
he strayed into a street where his sense of decorum was very
properly shocked.&nbsp; I know the street as I do every street in
Hamburg, and I know this, that it ill becomes Englishmen to write
of the immorality of Hamburg, or any other continental
town.&nbsp; Let him walk down Ratcliffe-highway or any other spot
where vice loses all its charms by appearing in all its
grossness.&nbsp; I fear that it is not true generally to the eyes
of the class she leads astray, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vice is a monster of such hideous mien,<br
/>
That to be hated, needs but to be seen,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but I think it is true, or at any rate it contains a portion
of truth, so far as regards Ratcliffe-highway, a stroll in which
place is sure to shock more senses than one.&nbsp; In beastliness
I think it surpasses Cologne with its seven <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>and thirty
stenches, or even Bristol or a Welsh town.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe-highway lies contiguous to the commerce and the port
of London.&nbsp; The men and boys engaged in navigating merchant
vessels belonging to ports of the British Empire were in 1851,
240,298; and of this multitude a large portion at some time or
other resides in Ratcliffe-highway.&nbsp; In 1856, 826 vessels,
with a tonnage of 498,594 tons, entered the port of London.&nbsp;
Jack, when he&rsquo;s ashore, resides here, and Jack ashore is
the weakest and simplest of men.&nbsp; As an illustration of the
way in which Jack is done&mdash;whether in any provincial port or
London, for crimps are the same all the world over,&mdash;let me
refer to a case heard at the Tynemouth Police Court towards the
end of last year.&nbsp; A man named Glover, the landlord of a low
public-house in Clive-street, a crimp and sailors&rsquo;
lodging-house keeper, was summoned under the 235th and 236th
clauses of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, charged with having
taken into his possession the moneys and effects of James Hall, a
seaman, and with having refused to return and pay the same back
to Hall when requested to do so.&nbsp; It appears, after being
engaged in the <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Black Sea in the transport service
during the late war, Hall, who had to receive &pound;30
15<i>s.</i>, took up his quarters at Glover&rsquo;s, and made him
his &ldquo;purser.&rdquo;&nbsp; Glover charged him 14<i>s.</i>
a-week for his lodgings, the same as the Sailors&rsquo; Home, but
at the end of 16 days he told him that his money was all gone,
and bought the plaintiff&rsquo;s neckerchief of him for
1<i>s.</i>, which he also spent in drink.&nbsp; The sailor,
finding himself destitute, had applied to the authorities, who
summoned Glover.&nbsp; Glover, in his defence, stated that Hall
had spent his money in drink and treating, keeping a couple of
bagpipers to play to him all the time he was on the spree.&nbsp;
Glover produced the following extraordinary account against
Hall:&mdash;&ldquo;Dec. 9th.&mdash;20 pints of rum, &pound;2
6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 20 quarts of beer, and 15 ounces of
tobacco, 15<i>s.</i>&nbsp; 10th.&mdash;8 glasses of rum, and
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> borrowed money, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
11th.&mdash;Borrowed money, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 5 pints of
rum, 5 gills of rum, and 15 quarts of ale, &pound;1 12<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>; 6 ounces of tobacco, 2 glasses of gin, and 2 gills of
brandy, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; 12th.&mdash;Cash, 2<i>s.</i>,
15 pints of rum, and 28 gills of rum, &pound;3; 4 quarts, half a
gallon, and 22 gills of beer, &pound;1 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; 15
glasses of rum and 11 glasses of beer, 9<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>;
pint of brandy and 16 glasses of <!-- page 80--><a

8<i>s.</i>; 36 ounces of tobacco and 3&frac12; glasses of gin,
12<i>s.</i> 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>&nbsp; 13th.&mdash;18 pints of rum,
15 gills of rum, and 26 quarts of beer, &pound;3 4<i>s.</i>; 26
bottles of lemonade, and 28 gills of beer, &pound;1; 14 ounces of
tobacco, 6 glasses of gin, 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; 12 glasses of
gingerade, and cash 5<i>s.</i>, 8<i>s.</i>; 1 week&rsquo;s board,
14<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Paid for clothes, &pound;1 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>; 2 pints of rum, 10 gills of rum, and 4 glasses of
beer, 16<i>s.</i>; 24 glasses of spirits, 9 quarts of beer, and 7
ounces of tobacco, 14<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>&nbsp; 15th.&mdash;16
half glasses of spirits, 10 glasses and 2 gills of rum, and
1&frac12; ounce of tobacco, and beer, 2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>;
fortnight&rsquo;s board, &pound;1 8<i>s.</i>; cash, &pound;2
18<i>s.</i>; spirits, tobacco, and rum, 4<i>s.</i>
1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; cash, 5<i>s.</i>&nbsp; 17th.&mdash;Cash,
7<i>s.</i>; 20 glasses of spirits, and 8 quarts of ale,
9<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; 18th.&mdash;Ale, spirits, and
tobacco, 16<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; 19th.&mdash;35 glasses of
spirits, and 20 glasses of ale, and 2 glasses of brandy, &pound;1
4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>&nbsp; 20th.&mdash;Ale, tobacco, and cash,
7<i>s.</i>&nbsp; 24th, 25th, and 26th.&mdash;Ale and spirits,
7<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, and other items, making up the amount in
hand.&nbsp; The defendant had refused to deliver up Hall&rsquo;s
clothes on the plea that the man was in his debt.&nbsp; Now in
Ratcliffe-highway such men as Glover abound.&nbsp; It is
unnecessary then to describe the character of the tradesmen in
Ratcliffe-highway, or the character <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>of their
wares.&nbsp; At one shop there are the enormous boots, which only
navvies and sailors have strength to wear; at another there are
oilskin caps, and coats and trousers, or rough woollen shirts,
piled up in gigantic masses.&nbsp; One shop rejoices in compasses
and charts, and another in the huge silver watches which Jack
invariably affects.&nbsp; The descendants of Abraham swarm
here.&nbsp; They sell little fish fried in oil; they deal in
second-hand clothes; they keep lodging-houses; I believe they
stick at nothing to turn a penny, and don&rsquo;t break their
hearts if the penny turns out a dishonest one.&nbsp; Everything
has a nautical adaptation.&nbsp; The songs sung are
nautical.&nbsp; The last time I was there an old woman was
singing to a crowd of the &ldquo;Saucy Sailor Boy&rdquo; who,
coming disguised in poverty to his lady love, is by her
ignominiously rejected, to whom rejecting he tells of his real
riches, and by whom the rejection is eagerly recalled, but in
vain, for the Saucy Sailor Boy declares:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do you think I am foolish, love?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think I am mad,<br />
For to wed a poor country girl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When there&rsquo;s fortune to be had?</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll cross the briny ocean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the meadows are so green,<br />
And since you have refused my offer, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other girl shall wear the ring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up and down Ratcliffe-highway do the sailors of every country
under heaven stroll&mdash;Greeks and Scythians, bond and
free.&nbsp; Uncle Tom&rsquo;s numerous progeny are
there&mdash;Lascars, Chinese, bold Britons, swarthy Italians,
sharp Yankees, fair-haired Saxons, and adventurous
Danes&mdash;men who worship a hundred gods, and men who worship
none.&nbsp; They have ploughed the stormy main, they have known
the perils of a treacherous sea and of a lee shore; but there are
worse perils, and those perils await them in
Ratcliffe-highway.&nbsp; It is night, and the glare of gas gives
the street a cheerful appearance.&nbsp; We pass the
Sailor&rsquo;s Home, a noble institution which deserves our
cordial support and praise, and find at almost every step
pitfalls for poor Jack.&nbsp; Every few yards we come to a
beer-shop or a public-house, the doors of which stand temptingly
open, and from the upper room of which may be heard the sound of
the mirth-inspiring violin, and the tramp of toes neither
&ldquo;light nor fantastic.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were public-houses
<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>here&mdash;I know not if the custom prevails
now&mdash;to which was attached a crew of infamous women; these
bring Jack into the house to treat them, but while Jack drinks
gin the landlord gives them from another tap water, and then
against their sober villany poor Jack has no chance.&nbsp; I fear
many respectable people in this neighbourhood have thus made
fortunes.&nbsp; Jack is prone to grog and dancing, and here they
meet him at every turn.&nbsp; Women, wild-eyed, boisterous, with
cheeks red with rouge and flabby with intemperance, decked out
with dresses and ribbons of the gayest hue, are met with by
hundreds&mdash;all alike equally coarse, and insolent, and
unlovely in manners and appearance, but all equally resolved on
victimising poor Jack.&nbsp; They dance with him in the
beer-shop&mdash;they drink with him in the bar&mdash;they walk
with him in the streets&mdash;they go with him to such places as
Wilton&rsquo;s Music Hall, where each Jack Tar may be seen
sitting with his pipe and his pot, witnessing dramatic
performances not very artistic, but really, on the score of
morality, not so objectionable as what I have seen applauded by
an Adelphi audience, or patronised by the upper classes at her
Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; And thus the evening <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>passes away; the publicans grow rich, the keepers of
infamous houses fatten on their dishonest gains&mdash;obese Jews
and Jewesses become more so.&nbsp; The grog gets into
Jack&rsquo;s head&mdash;the unruly tongue of woman is
loosened&mdash;there are quarrels, and blows, and blood drawn,
and heads broken, and cries of police, and victims in abundance
for the station-house, or the hospital, or the union-house, or
the lunatic asylum, save when some forlorn one (and not seldom
either is this the case), reft of hope or maddened by drink and
shame, plunges in the muddy waters of some neighbouring dock, to
find the oblivion she found not in the dancing and drinking
houses of Ratcliffe-highway.</p>

85</span>JUDGE AND JURY CLUBS.</h2>
<p>This<span class="smcap"> </span>is a comic age in which we
live.&nbsp; We are overdone with funny writers.&nbsp; The
ghastliest attempts at liveliness surround us on every
side.&nbsp; I would not bring back the grave deportment and
stately etiquette of days gone by, nor could I if I would.&nbsp;
But are we not running to another extreme?&nbsp; Is there not a
lack of reverence and dignity?&nbsp; If we train up our youth to
comic Blackstones, and teach them to extract fun out of the
grandest history done in modern Europe&mdash;the history of the
Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;of the race that has founded civil and
religious liberty, and still nurses it in the face of a frowning
continent, what can we expect?&nbsp; Men are what we make
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just as the twig is bent the tree&rsquo;s
inclined.&rdquo;&nbsp; A feeble and contemptible father is
succeeded by a feeble and contemptible son.&nbsp; Have no grand
creed of your own to make your daily path lustrous with the light
of heaven.&nbsp; Crack your weak jest and pun at all <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>men
have reverenced.&nbsp; Learn from <i>Punch</i> to titter, no
matter the theme.&nbsp; And can you wonder that your son believes
not in man&rsquo;s honour or woman&rsquo;s love&mdash;in God or
the devil, but solely in the Holborn Casino and Cremorne?&nbsp;
For instance, is not law one of the most wonderful achievements
of civilisation?&nbsp; I do not go so far as &ldquo;the judicious
Hooker.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not say with him that her seat is the
throne of God, her voice the harmony of the universe, but is it
not wonderful to think of the complex arrangements of which the
judge seated in his robes on the bench, administering law, is the
outward sign.&nbsp; In the first place, man must have learnt to
give up a primary instinct of his nature&mdash;that of
self-revenge.&nbsp; Then the central power in the darkest parts
of the land must have become dominant.&nbsp; What ages must have
past before law dared meddle with privilege, or before its
administrators could realize the fact of the sanctity of the
individual man, whether he starved in a garret or feasted in a
palace.&nbsp; And when the judges went on circuit, with the
gorgeous cavalcade of the olden time, what terror was struck into
the hearts of the rustics, and how patent became to them the
strength and dignity of law.&nbsp; Now <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>why burlesque
this?&nbsp; The idea is good and true, yet the burlesque is
permitted and exists, aye, even to this day.</p>
<p>It is years since I was at a Judge and Jury Club, but I
believe their character is in no degree changed.&nbsp; The one I
speak of met in an hotel not far from Covent-garden, and was
presided over by a man famous in his day for his power of
<i>double entendre</i>.&nbsp; About nine o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, if you went up-stairs you would find a large room with
benches capable of accommodating, I should think, a hundred, or a
hundred and fifty persons.&nbsp; This room was generally well
filled, and by their appearance the audience was one you would
call respectable.&nbsp; The entrance fee entitled you to
refreshment, and that refreshment, in the shape of intoxicating
liquor, was by that time before each visitant.&nbsp; After
waiting a few minutes, a rustle at the entrance would cause you
to turn your eyes in that direction, when, heralded by a crier
with a gown and a staff of office, exclaiming, &ldquo;Make way
for my Lord Chief Baron,&rdquo; that illustrious individual would
be seen wending his way to his appointed seat.&nbsp; The man I
write of was then about thirty-five, but he appeared much older,
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>and in his robes of office and with his judicial wig had
almost a venerable appearance.&nbsp; Having seated himself and
bowed to the bar&mdash;one of them they called the double of
Brougham had been a dissenting minister (he is dead now&mdash;he
died &ldquo;game,&rdquo; they told me)&mdash;the Lord Chief Baron
called for &ldquo;a cigar and glass of brandy and water, and,
having observed that the waiter was in the room and that he hoped
gentlemen would give their orders, the proceedings of the evening
commenced.&nbsp; A jury was selected; the prosecutor opened his
case, which, to suit the depraved taste of his patrons, was
invariably one of seduction or crim. con.&nbsp; Witnesses were
examined and cross-examined, the females being men dressed up in
women&rsquo;s clothes, and everything was done that could be to
pander to the lowest propensities of depraved humanity.&nbsp; I
do not believe the audience could have stood this if it had not
been for the drink.&nbsp; As it was, I believe many a youth fresh
from home felt a little ashamed of himself that he should be in
such company listening to such unmitigated ribaldry, but these
reflections were soon drowned in the flowing bowl, and the lad,
if he blushed at first, soon learned to laugh.&nbsp; I write of
the time <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>when the railway mania had filled
London with overpaid engineers, and attorneys, and parliamentary
witnesses, only too anxious to see life, as they called it, and
by whom this beastly entertainment was frequented night after
night.&nbsp; I dare not even attempt to give a faint outline of
the proceedings.&nbsp; After the defence, came the summing up,
which men about town told you was a model of wit, but in which
the wit bore but a small proportion to the obscenity.&nbsp; The
jury were complimented on their intelligent and lascivious
appearance, all the filthy particulars which had been noticed
were referred to Dog Latin, and poetical quotations were
plentifully thrown in; and by twelve, amidst the plaudits of the
audience, the affair, so far as the Judge and Jury Club was
concerned, was over.&nbsp; Then there was supper for such as
wished it, and an entertainment to follow, either in the shape of
a concert or of an exhibition of <i>Pos&eacute;s
Plastiques</i>.&nbsp; To these subsequent entertainments ladies
were generally admitted&mdash;and perhaps the less I say about
them or their proceedings the better.&nbsp; If I refer to them at
all, it is but as an illustration of the drinking customs of
society.&nbsp; These Judge and Jury Clubs after all are but an
excuse for <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>drinking.&nbsp; They are held at
public-houses&mdash;there is drinking going on all the time the
trial lasts,&mdash;nor could sober men listen unless they had the
drink.&nbsp; I believe an attempt has been made to introduce this
kind of thing to the provinces, but it has not answered.&nbsp; In
all our provincial towns there exists a public opinion which
guarantees decency to a certain extent.&nbsp; In the metropolis
this public opinion does not exist.&nbsp; No one knows that I
frequent Judge and Jury Clubs, and I lose no social status if I
do; and some of the men who patronise them have no social status
to lose.&nbsp; In one of the lowest beershops in the New Cut the
other day I saw it announced that on Sunday night a Judge and
Jury Club was held.&nbsp; It is too true that we are, as Tennyson
says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fish that love the mud,<br />
Rising to no fancy flies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But man does not naturally revel in obscenity; the modesty of
nature will stick to him for years.&nbsp; But the Judge and Jury
Clubs make you familiar with the manners of the stews; and I
solemnly believe that in Sodom and Gomorrah nothing more filthy
could have been talked about, and that this side Pandemonium
there is nothing <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>more debasing or debased.&nbsp; If
you wish to see your son thoroughly depraved, send him to a Judge
and Jury Club.&nbsp; In a little while he will come back to you
with every noble principle blotted out, with a mind stored with
pollution, and with a fitting phraseology, ready to run a mad
career of debauchery and vice.&nbsp; Some fifteen years back the
writer was at college, and one of his fellow-students was a fine
young fellow, the heir to a decent fortune, and said to be
connected with a noble family.&nbsp; The last time I was at the
Judge and Jury he was employed as one of the mock counsel; but he
became too intemperate even for that, and enlisted, and miserably
died.&nbsp; They have tragic ends, many of these frequenters of
Judge and Jury Clubs, and it is sad to think that, when the
merriment is the loudest, and the drink is most stimulating, and
the fellowship most jovial, there is burlesque even then.</p>

92</span>THE CAVE OF HARMONY.</h2>
<p>Reader, do you know the Cave of Harmony?&nbsp; If you do not,
so much the better.&nbsp; If you are one of its
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i>, I fear no words of mine can make you
forsake it.&nbsp; It is said the Cave is altered since we were
there&mdash;so much the better; Thackeray, I think, had something
to do with that reform&mdash;and that now nothing objectionable
is sung.&nbsp; Still, I doubt whether drinking and harmony after
12 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> can do much good.&nbsp; You
and I, it may be, are old men,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ruin&rsquo;d trunks on wither&rsquo;d
forks,<br />
Empty scarecrows you and I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have run through youth with money in our pockets and time
on our hands, and have seen all that life can offer, and know,
what so many do not, that pleasure&rsquo;s cup but sparkles near
the brim.&nbsp; What we have done and been has been wine working
on the fiery impulses of young blood, but now, sir, with our hair
turning grey and our eyes growing dim, shall we not lift up a
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>warning voice, and ask youth to pause ere it take the
final plunge which for years, it may be for ever, shall estrange
it from innocence, and peace, and God.</p>
<p>It is midnight in the great city in which we write.&nbsp; For
a while sorrow and care are veiled from the eyes of men, and to
the poorest and most toilworn come pleasant dreams.&nbsp; The
shops have long been closed, the roar of the streets has died
away, the theatres have discharged their jaded crowds, and as we
walk along, meeting now and then a poor drunkard reeling
home&mdash;or a policeman silently patrolling the
streets&mdash;or one of the unfortunates, by turns man&rsquo;s
victim and curse&mdash;or some of the votaries of dissipation who
are awake when other men are asleep&mdash;we realize all the
grandeur and poetry and magnificence of London by night, and
wonder not that Savage and Johnson should have found such a
fascination in the scene, and that other sons of genius have read
such sermons in its eloquent stones.&nbsp; Let us stroll towards
Covent Garden&mdash;in another hour it will be ringing with the
oaths and execrations of seemingly all the market gardeners in
Middlesex&mdash;and enter that doorway indicated by the glare of
gas; come with me <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>down these stairs, and into that
room, the door of which the waiter holds obligingly open.&nbsp;
Let us stand here while we recover from the effect of the fumes
of grog and the smoke of tobacco.&nbsp; You find yourself in a
room holding perhaps 1200 gentlemen; look around, this is a
respectable place, this Cave of Harmony, there are no poor people
here.&nbsp; We have heavy swells, moustached, and with white
kids&mdash;officers in the army&mdash;scions of noble
houses&mdash;country gentlemen, and merchants, and lawyers in
town on business&mdash;literary men, medical students, and old
fogies, with every moral sensibility dead, who have sat here for
years listening to the same songs and the same outpourings; they
could tell you something, these old fogies&mdash;what changes
they have seen, as one generation after another of students and
rakes and men about town have thought it fast to sup every night
within these walls; of course the majority in the room are
clerks, and commercial gents, and fellows in Government
situations, learning here the extravagance which in time will
compel them to commit frauds and forgery, and eventually perhaps
land them in a felon&rsquo;s jail.&nbsp; For the Cave of Harmony
is not a cheap place to <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>sup at.&nbsp; The chop and baked
potatoes are excellent but dear, and four or five shillings is a
sum soon spent if you do as every one here does,&mdash;take your
pint of stout, and three or four glasses of grog; and the chances
are you will meet a friend, who will persuade you to make a night
of it and stroll West with him, where you will see Vice flaunting
more finely and with greater bravery than in any other capital in
Europe.&nbsp; But let us drop these considerations.&nbsp; We are
at one end of a long room, at the other is a raised platform, on
which is a piano, and in front of which some half-dozen gentlemen
are seated&mdash;these are the performers.&nbsp; Their faces you
know well enough, for they are in much repute for dinners at the
London Tavern or the Freemasons, and the last time I dined with
the Indigent Blind&mdash;with a High Church dignitary in the
chair&mdash;we had the whole half-dozen to assist; they are good
singers, I willingly confess, and sing many of them touching
songs of youth, and hope, and true love, and home&mdash;but they
don&rsquo;t sing the better for singing during the small hours
and in a drinking saloon.&nbsp; That little Hebrew, who has been
at it, he tells me, for upwards of forty years, is not an
improvisatore <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>like Theodore Hook, but he does it
well enough for an audience good-natured and a little the worse
for drink.&nbsp; The imitations of a barnyard, with its cows, and
geese, and turkeys, and other live stock, by that poor, seedy,
needy, smiling German, are amusing to hear once, but every one
here has heard them over and over again.&nbsp; What they need is
something richer, and more spicy, as they term it.&nbsp; You see
they are getting tired of sentimental songs, and war songs, and
madrigals, and glees.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t want to
hear&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know a maiden fair to see,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Down in a flowery vale,<br />
All on a summer morning,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In going to my lonely bed<br />
As one that would have slept.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are careless when Podder sings &ldquo;Kathleen
Mavourneen,&rdquo; and are indifferent to the manner in which
Brown renders</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beautiful Venice, city of song.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In old times, before the obscenity of the place was done away
with, towards early morning it seemed a perfect Babel.&nbsp; A
favourite&rsquo;s name was sounded&mdash;it was repeated with
every variety of <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>emphasis in every corner of the room;
the tables were struck with drunken fists till the tumult became
a perfect storm; the master of the place raps the table with an
auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer&mdash;&ldquo;Silence, gentlemen, if you
please, Mr --- will sing a comic song;&rdquo; and immediately a
man in a beggar&rsquo;s costume, and with the face of an idiot,
jumps upon the stage.&nbsp; His appearance was a signal for a
whirlwind of applause.&nbsp; He sang, with accompanying action,
some dozen verses of doggerel, remarkable for obscenity and
imbecility.&nbsp; You looked around, but not a blush did you see
in that crowded room; not one single head was held down in shame;
not one high-spirited gentleman rushed indignantly from the
place.&nbsp; On the contrary, the singer was greeted with the
most lavish expression of applause, continued so loudly and so
long that again the proprietor had to announce, &ldquo;Mr ---
will sing another comic song.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this time the
comic singer would not dress for his part, and you saw a young,
good-looking, well-dressed, gentlemanly fellow voluntarily
degrading himself for the pleasure of men more degraded
still.&nbsp; You tell me the comic singer is a happy fellow, that
he gets six guineas a-week, that he lives in a nice little
cottage in <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the Hampstead-road.&nbsp; I know
better than you; the man I write of, after having been the
attraction of the Cave of Harmony for years, after having been
feasted by the nobility and gentry, after having led a career of
pleasure on the most extravagant scale, will go down yet young as
a beggar to one of our sea-port towns, and, after craving in vain
a refuge from the winter&rsquo;s cold and a crust of bread, will
die in the workhouse, and be buried in a pauper&rsquo;s
grave.&nbsp; How many of the gay young fellows now around us will
have a similar termination to their career!&nbsp; I never can
pass the Cave of Harmony without thinking of the comic singer as
last I saw him&mdash;in the very flush of health and life,
stimulated by wine and applause, little dreaming of the workhouse
in which he was so soon to beg for room to die.&nbsp; But this
exhibition is of the past,&mdash;the place is reformed; and how
it is patronized is clear, when I state that on the night of the
marriage of the Princess Royal, there were consumed in it 21
dozen kidneys, 478 chops, 280 Welsh rabbits, 1500 glasses of
stout, and a hogshead of pale ale.</p>

99</span>DISCUSSION CLUBS.</h2>
<p>It<span class="smcap"> </span>is the condition of a
public-house that it must do a good business some way or
other.&nbsp; Mr Hinton, who has just got his license for Highbury
Barn, says the dining apartment fell off and he was obliged to
institute Soir&eacute;es Dansantes.&nbsp; Sometimes the publican
gets a female dressed up in a Bloomer costume; sometimes he has
for his barman a giant, or a dwarf, or an Albino, or a Kaffir
chief&mdash;actually as an attraction to decent people to go and
drink their pot of beer.&nbsp; I find the following advertisement
in the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Sheep-eater of Hindostan.&mdash;To be
seen, the Sheep-eater of Hindostan, representing an exhibition
which took place on the 3rd of March, 1796, before Colonel
Patrick Douglas and other officers of a battalion of Native
Infantry, and a great concourse of the inhabitants of the
military station of Futtehghur.&nbsp; It is engraved from a
sketch, taken on the spot by a native artist, and <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>under the inspection of Major-General Hardwicke,
F.R.S.&nbsp; The Sheep-eater was a native of India, about thirty
years of age, five feet nine inches high, slender, well formed,
and rather muscular.&nbsp; He was attended by a very old man,
whom he called his father or preceptor, termed by the natives
Gooroo or Priest, who stated he had formerly followed the same
practice.&nbsp; He was above the ordinary stature of the natives
of India, and wore his hair, which was of great length, coiled
into the form of a turban; and his beard was twisted like a rope,
and nearly reached his feet, being five feet eight inches in
length.&nbsp; The exhibitor began his operation by raising the
sheep from the ground with his teeth.&nbsp; He then threw the
animal on its back, and, with his teeth and hands only, separated
the limbs, and stript the flesh from the bones.&nbsp; After
mixing dust with the meat, by rubbing it on the ground, in that
dirty state he swallowed what he tore off.&nbsp; The last part of
the operation was chewing the leaves of a plant, the local name
of which is Madaar (asclepias gigantea), and the milky juice,
which is of a very corrosive nature, he swallowed.&nbsp; Having
made a collection of money, and the assemblage of people <!--
page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>being much increased, he offered to eat a second sheep,
and actually commenced the operation as before.&nbsp; It may be
proper to observe, that the sheep in most parts of India are as
small as the Welsh sheep of Great Britain.&nbsp; No. 1.
represents lifting the sheep from the ground with his teeth
only.&nbsp; 2. Having thrown the sheep on its back, he extends
the limbs, preparatory to No. 3.&nbsp; 3. Ripping the animal open
from the flank to the breast.&nbsp; 4. Having removed the
intestines, &amp;c, he buries his head in the body, to drink the
blood collected.&nbsp; 5. Exhibiting his face, after this
sanguinary draught.&nbsp; 6. Having devoured every portion of
flesh from the bones, he chews the plant Madaar.&nbsp; 7. After
changing his waist-cloth, he returns with his Gooroo, or
preceptor, and offers to eat the second sheep, for the
satisfaction of the increased number of spectators.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not give the name of the spirited proprietor, but in his
advertisement he declares he intends exhibiting it <i>over the
bar for a short time gratuitously</i>.&nbsp; This is rich; it is
like the doctor&rsquo;s advice gratis.</p>
<p>Now in the same manner the publicans provide a weekly
discussion meeting for that part of the public that loves to hear
itself speak.&nbsp; There <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>is one at
the Belvidere, Pentonville; another at the Horns,
Kennington.&nbsp; Fleet-street is much favoured.&nbsp; There are
the Temple Forum, the Cogers&rsquo; Hall, and another large room
in Shoe-lane.&nbsp; These are gratuitous, like the picture in the
above advertisement&mdash;that is, you are expected to sit and
drink all night.&nbsp; The most celebrated one is that which
meets not far from the Temple, presided over by the editor of a
Sunday paper, and assisted by several reporters connected with
the daily journals.&nbsp; One of them not long since contested an
Irish borough on Protestant principles, but unfortunately,
instead of being returned, found himself in gaol for election
expenses.&nbsp; Besides these, there are many third and
fourth-rate literary men&mdash;a class, I fear (I speak of the
minors), the most braggart, lying, and needy under
heaven&mdash;men who are going to do wonders, but who never
do&mdash;whose success, if such a term may be applied to their
career, arises simply from their power of brag, and from the
possession of an enviable amount of self-esteem.&nbsp; Then there
are briefless barristers, but too happy to have an opportunity of
airing their dictionaries, and tradesmen, and clerks, all
fancying that there is no need why they should hide <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>their talents under a napkin.&nbsp; Still these places
do not flourish, and there are more bad speeches made than good
ones.&nbsp; You are cooped up in an inconvenient apartment,
suffocated by tobacco-smoke, and very unpleasantly affected by
the beer and gin-and-water which every one feels bound to
consume.&nbsp; The waiter is in the room, and you are expected to
give your orders.&nbsp; The speaking is a secondary
consideration.&nbsp; The first thing you are required to do is to
drink.&nbsp; I have how in my mind&rsquo;s eye a young fellow who
was a great man at one of these places.&nbsp; He was a clerk with
limited means, but he came to these places night after night, and
drank and spent his money freely.&nbsp; It is the old tale over
again.&nbsp; He was intrusted with his employer&rsquo;s
cash.&nbsp; He applied some of it to liquidate his
expenses.&nbsp; He was unable to replace it.&nbsp; Discovery was
made at last; he is now in Newgate, and his wife&mdash;for he was
just married&mdash;is breaking her young heart with shame and
want.&nbsp; The curse of these public-houses is that they lead
men into expense and reduce them into poverty, if they do not
almost necessitate crime.&nbsp; A discussion is all very well,
and the habit of being able to get up and say a few words when
occasion requires pertinent and <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span><i>apropos</i> is invaluable, but to acquire that habit
it is scarcely worth while to sit all night toping, while
Smithers is playing old gooseberry with his H&rsquo;s, or
O&rsquo;Flaherty raving of the wrongs of the Green Isle.&nbsp;
The questions discussed are generally such as are peculiar to the
time.&nbsp; Was Lord Cardigan a hero?&nbsp; Does Sir Benjamin
Hall deserve well of the public for his conduct with reference to
Sunday bands?&nbsp; Does the Palmerston cabinet deserve the
support of the country?&nbsp; Would Lord John Russell&rsquo;s
scheme of national education, if carried out, be a public
benefit?&nbsp; Let men talk on these subjects if they will, and
as long as they will, but I think they will think more clearly,
and talk better, and come sooner to a rational decision, if they
do not drink.&nbsp; I am sure I have seen the audience and the
orators more inflamed by beer than by eloquence, and when turned
out into the street after a long sitting, many, I imagine, have
seen a couple of moons and double the usual allowance of lamps
and police.&nbsp; The worst of it is, that after the discussion
is over, there will be always a few stop to have a bit of supper
and another glass.&nbsp; I remember, just as the war broke out, I
was at one of the places to which I have already <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>referred, the subject was the propriety of erecting on
the ruins of Turkey a united Greece.&nbsp; The Philhellenists
came down in great force, and young Greeks, Sophocles and
Ionides, and many more screaming at the top of their voices, were
there as well.&nbsp; What with the excitement of the subject and
what with the excitement of the drink, the whole affair settled
into a regular orgie, and the tumult of that night still rings
wildly in my ear.&nbsp; Dumbiedikes would have stared at the gift
of tongues exhibited on that occasion.</p>
<p>If you admire pot-house oratory, then attend one of these
places.&nbsp; The chair is generally taken about nine, and the
proceedings close at twelve.&nbsp; A gentleman already agreed on
commences the discussion, then the debate is left to drag its
slow length along, sometimes giving rise to animated discussions,
and at other times being a terrible failure.&nbsp; What is
considered the treat of the evening is generally something of
this sort&mdash;An indifferent speaker, perhaps a stranger, gets
up and makes a short speech, which brings up one of the old
seasoned debaters, great in his own eyes and in those of almost
every one present.&nbsp; I assure you he is down upon <!-- page
106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>the modest debutant in fine style, making mincemeat of
his facts, and ridiculing his logic.&nbsp; The easier his work
is, the more does he labour at it.&nbsp; The audience frantically
applaud, and the orator, as he sits down, evidently thinks
Brougham could not have slashed an opponent in better
style.&nbsp; The gravity of these speakers is really
amusing.&nbsp; Did they speak the language of millions&mdash;did
principles of eternal import dwell upon their tongue&mdash;did
nations breathlessly wait for their decisions&mdash;did they
shake the arsenal and fulmine over Greece&mdash;they could not
set about their work in a more determined manner.&nbsp; And
Jones, from his tremendous castigation of Palmerston, or fierce
diatribe against Lord John, will sneak off quietly to his back
garret in Pentonville, just as we can imagine Diocletian
abandoning an empire to plant cabbages at Salone.&nbsp; It is
clear some of the speakers are naturally good orators; but the
regular stagers have a seedy appearance, and that peculiar
redness of the nose or soddenness of the skin which indicates the
drinker; and if you go much, you will find a paper with
five-shilling subscriptions, and you will be asked to give your
name, for the benefit of some prominent debater whose affairs do
not <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>seem to have prospered, in spite of
their master&rsquo;s matchless powers of oratory.&nbsp; The truth
is, the money has been spent here in drink that was required
elsewhere, and wife and children have starved at home while the
orator was declaiming against Despotism abroad.&nbsp; I fear the
only class benefited by these discussions are the landlords, who
point to their door and whisper in your ears; Admission
gratis.&nbsp; Yes, that is true; but the egress, ah,
there&rsquo;s the rub!&nbsp; It is that for which you must pay,
and pay handsomely, too, as hundreds of poor fellows have found
to their cost.</p>
<h2><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>THE CYDER CELLARS.</h2>
<p>In<span class="smcap"> </span>the days of the gay and
graceless Charles, Bow-street was the Bond-street of
London.&nbsp; In the taverns of that quarter were the true homes
and haunts of the British poets.&nbsp; That they were much better
for all their drinking and worship of the small hours, I more
than doubt.&nbsp; Pope tried the pace, but found it killing, and
had the wisdom to go and live at Twickenham, and cease to play
the part of a man about town.&nbsp; Describing Addison&rsquo;s
life at this period, he says, &ldquo;He usually studied all the
morning, then met his party at Button&rsquo;s, and dined there,
and stayed there five or six hours, and sometimes far into the
night.&nbsp; I was of the company for about a year, but found it
too much for me.&nbsp; <i>I hurt my health</i>, <i>and so I
quitted it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the wits died off, and
Tom&rsquo;s, Will&rsquo;s, Button&rsquo;s became desolate, and in
their place the Cyder Cellars grew famous.</p>
<p>You know Maiden-lane, where an old hair-dresser <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>had a son born to him, who, under the name of Turner,
won his way to the first rank amongst English
painters,&mdash;where Voltaire, &ldquo;so witty, profligate, and
thin,&rdquo; lodged at the house of a French peruke-maker, and
corresponded with Swift, and Pope, and the other literary men of
the times,&mdash;where Fielding laid the foundation of an eternal
fame,&mdash;where Andrew Marvell refused courtly bribes, and in
sublime poverty proudly picked his mutton-bone: there, some long
time since, stood a mansion, the residence, in a green old age,
of that Nell Gwynne of whom, with a strange perversity, the world
speaks as kindly as if she were a Grace Darling, or a Florence
Nightingale, or a Margaret Fuller, or an Elizabeth Fry.&nbsp; A
portion of the old house still remains, with its ancient
wainscotting.&nbsp; Well, on the site of this mansion was, and
is, the Cyder Cellars, the oldest house of its class in London,
actually referred to in a rare pamphlet now extant in the British
Museum, entitled &ldquo;Adventures Under-ground in the Year
1750.&rdquo;&nbsp; In those days to drink deep was deemed a
virtue, and the literary class, after the exhausting labours of
the day, loved nothing better than to sit soaking all night in
the Cyder Cellars, <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>where all restraints were thrown on
one aide,&mdash;where the song was sung and the wine was quaffed,
and men were fools enough to think they were getting happy when
they were only getting drunk.&nbsp; I can understand why the wits
went to the Cyder Cellars then.&nbsp; Few of them lived in a
style in which they would like to receive their friends.&nbsp; In
a place like the Cyder Cellars they could meet after the theatres
were closed, and the occupations of the day over, and sup and
talk and drink with more freedom than in any private house; and
no doubt many were the ingenuous youths who went to the Cyder
Cellars to see the learned Mr. Bayle, or the great Grecian
Porson, or the eminent tragedian Mr. Edmund Kean, and thought it
a fine thing to view those distinguished men maudlin, or obscene,
or blasphemous, over their cups.&nbsp; But the wits do not go to
the Cyder Cellars now.&nbsp; Even the men about town do not go
there much.&nbsp; I remember when that dismal song, &ldquo;Sam
Hall,&rdquo; was sung&mdash;a song in which a wretch is supposed
to utter all the wretchedness in his soul, all his sickness of
life, all his abhorrence of mankind, as he was on his way to
Tyburn drop.&nbsp; Horrible as the song was&mdash;revolting <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>as it was to all but <i>blaz&eacute;</i> men, the room
was crammed to suffocation,&mdash;it was impossible often to get
a seat, and you might have heard a pin drop.&nbsp; Where are the
crowds that listened to that song?&nbsp; My own
companion&mdash;where is he?&nbsp; A finer young man, with richer
promise, I knew not.&nbsp; He had a generous disposition, a taste
for study, and was blessed with the constitution of a horse; he
had received a liberal education; his morals had been carefully
attended to; his parents were people of large property, and this
son I always deemed his mother&rsquo;s favourite son; and now in
his very prime, when he might have been a blessing to society,
when in his successful professional career his parents might have
reaped a reward, when the heart of some loving, tender, trusting
woman might have joyed in his love, when fair young children,
calling him father, might have clustered round his knees, he is
dying, I am told, before their very eyes, slowly, and with agony,
from the terrible effects of drink.&nbsp; And does it not really
seem as if there were a curse attaching to those connected with
the trade?&nbsp; A week or two since, had you been passing down
Bridges-street into the Strand late on a Saturday night, or early
on a Sunday <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>morning, on a door-step, in spite of
the pouring rain, you might have seen a woman, in her rags and
loneliness, trying to gather a few hours of sleep.&nbsp; She was
too weak to pursue her unhallowed calling, and had she been so
disposed on that cold, wet night, it would have been of little
avail had she walked the streets.&nbsp; The policeman as he goes
his monotonous rounds tells her to move on.&nbsp; She wakes up,
gets upon her legs, hobbles along, and then, when he is past,
again, weary and wayworn, seeks the friendly door-step.&nbsp; The
policeman returns; &ldquo;What, here still?&rdquo; he
exclaims.&nbsp; Ah yes! she has not power to move away.&nbsp; She
is weak, ill, dying.&nbsp; The friendly police carry her to the
neighbouring hospital.&nbsp; &ldquo;She cannot be received
here,&rdquo; says Routine, and she is taken to the
workhouse.&nbsp; Again she is taken to the hospital, admitted at
last&mdash;for is she not a woman, and a young one,
too?&mdash;not more than twenty-five, it appears,&mdash;and on
her face, stained with intemperance and sin, there is the dread
stamp of death&mdash;in this case, perhaps, a welcome messenger;
for who would live, fallen, friendless, forsaken, with a diseased
body and a broken heart?&nbsp; &ldquo;The spirit of a man can
sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>can bear?&rdquo;&nbsp; Peace be with her! in another
hour or two she will have done with this wretched life of hers,
and have gone where &ldquo;the wicked cease from troubling, and
the weary are at rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; More than usual official
cruelty is visible in this case, for all that is given her
between her admission and her death is a simple cup of tea; and
the coroner&rsquo;s verdict very properly censures the hospital
authorities.&nbsp; Well, what connexion, you ask, is there with
this girl&rsquo;s sad fate and the jollity of the Cyder
Cellars?&nbsp; Only this, that her father made the Cyder Cellars
so popular a place of resort.&nbsp; If I go there again I shall
think of Louisa Regan, who began life as the daughter of a
successful publican, who had been a governess in a
nobleman&rsquo;s family, at the early age of twenty-five rescued
from the streets by policemen, and dependent on charity for a bed
on which to die.&nbsp; In the foaming cup, in the glitter of the
gas, while the comic singer was most comical, or the sentimental
singer most sentimental, I could not be oblivious of her
fate.&nbsp; Is there not poison in the bowl?&nbsp; Is there not
madness in the merriment?&nbsp; To the night so bright does there
not come a dolorous morrow?&nbsp; You may sing and laugh the
hours away in the <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Cyder Cellars for a while, but you
must pay your reckoning, and then, I imagine, you will doubt
whether the amusement was worth the price.&nbsp; Youth generally
pays too dear for its whistle.&nbsp; Youth is finding this out;
at any rate the days of the Cyder Cellars are numbered, and now,
with its Judge and Jury and <i>Poses Plastiques</i>, it collects
comparatively few.</p>
<p>Let me ask, need the amusements of our leisure hours be thus
based on false principles?&nbsp; Cambridge, in one of the
pleasantest papers in the &ldquo;World,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;Among
the numbers who have changed a sober plan of living for one of
riot and excess, the greatest part have been converted by the
arguments in a drinking song.&rdquo;&nbsp; Life is real, life is
earnest.&nbsp; It is a battle-ground which requires heart and
muscle, and where only the brave can conquer; but if I drop for
half-an-hour into a music hall, I learn that pleasure is the
great aim of life, and that gin can make me jolly and a
genius.</p>
<h2><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>LEICESTER-SQUARE.</h2>
<p>One<span class="smcap"> </span>of the peculiar institutions of
the country is the square.&nbsp; Charles Knight
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Piazza, Place, Platz, of Italy, France, or
Germany, have little in common with it.&nbsp; Its elements are
simple enough&mdash;an open space of a square figure, houses on
each of the four sides, and an enclosed centre with turf, a few
trees, and, it may be, flowers; and there is a
square.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are fashionable squares, all alive
with the sound of carriage-wheels and the chaste accents of a
thousand flunkeys; there are city squares, dull, dark places,
with old red-brick houses, and a stunted, smoke-dried shrub or
two in the middle.&nbsp; Then there are respectable squares,
which never were fashionable, nor ever aimed to be such; and then
there are squares which were once fashionable, but now are sadly
gone out of repute.&nbsp; One of the chief of these is
Leicester-square.&nbsp; Do our readers remember how Queen
Caroline found time to be the mother of seven <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>promising
children, of whom the eldest, Frederick, Prince of Wales, was a
continual source of sorrow and vexation to both his
parents?&nbsp; &ldquo;He resembled,&rdquo; writes Horace Walpole,
with his usual sneer, &ldquo;the Black Prince only in dying
before his father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, there was a house built
before the Commonwealth, called Leicester-house.&nbsp; Hither
came this young, dissipated, short-lived Prince, and fixed his
court.&nbsp; When he passed away, and the wits wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies Fred,<br />
Who was alive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And is dead,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>still the place had the prestige of fashion.&nbsp; It
gradually assumed the shape of a square, and became the
dwelling-place of men truly great.&nbsp; Sir Isaac Newton resided
near the square, in a house yet standing, and known to fast men
as Bertolini&rsquo;s, <i>alias</i> the Newton Hotel.&nbsp; Where
now we see the Sabloni&egrave;re Hotel, Hogarth once dwelt, and
at a later time Sir Joshua Reynolds lived on the opposite side of
the square.&nbsp; In its neighbourhood Sir Charles Bell made his
discoveries respecting the nervous system, and here the renowned
John Hunter lived.&nbsp; In later times Wordsworth made it the
scene of his <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Moon-gazers; and if he could term it
&ldquo;Leicester&rsquo;s busy square,&rdquo; still more is that
epithet appropriate to it at the present time.&nbsp; It is true
that the Great Globe is not a success; that the Panopticon
failed; that the Western Literary Institution did not flourish;
that the place is not literary or scientific, nor even
business-like, for by daylight the shops look seedy, and the
wares exhibited are somewhat of the cheapest.&nbsp; But at night
a change comes over the spirit of its dream.&nbsp; Here, from
cheap lodging-houses hard by, from cold garrets or dark and dusty
two-pair backs, crawl out to walk its flagstones, or taint its
air with the smoke of cheap cigars, men of all nations and
tongues&mdash;French, Germans, Italians, Spaniards,
Poles&mdash;the scoundrels and patriots of Europe.&nbsp; There is
business here now; the air is laden with the sickly odour of a
thousand dinners.&nbsp; Hotels and <i>caf&eacute;s</i> and
<i>restaurants</i> are lit up and gay.&nbsp; Mr Smith opens the
Alhambra on Sundays and week-days for Music for the Million; and
women, rouged and dressed as much as possible like the nude
figures, degrade our conceptions of Venus, and Sappho, and the
Syrens, and others of our classic acquaintances, by the
exhibition of them in questionable <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>groupings
tolerated as <i>poses plastiques</i>.&nbsp; Wine-shades attract
us; we hear the clink of billiards.&nbsp; This house we know to
be a betting house&mdash;that to be a hell.&nbsp; A man runs up
against us.&nbsp; He turns round and apologizes.&nbsp; I catch a
glimpse of his face.&nbsp; I see at once that he is a
billiard-room shark.&nbsp; Look at his pale face, his cold eye,
his hard mouth; and don&rsquo;t play with him, however
civil.&nbsp; Above all, don&rsquo;t imagine from his exterior
that he is a gentleman.&nbsp; A gentleman does not wear slop-shop
clothes nor mosaic gold.</p>
<p>You wish to sit down.&nbsp; Well, as it is past the midnight
hour, we will go into this <i>Caf&eacute; Chansante</i>.&nbsp; At
any rate the foreigners have more taste than ourselves.&nbsp; The
pretty young girls, French or German, at the bar give the place a
pleasant appearance, and the mirrors on all sides reflect the gay
forms and faces here assembled.&nbsp; But we pass into the
concert room, where some Spanish minstrels in national costumes
are singing national airs.&nbsp; As you are not musical and
cannot understand these distinguished foreigners, let us see who
are here, the Swiss Kellner, with his wonted civility, having
first brought us a cup of coffee and a cigar.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know why it is <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>so, but it always struck me that of
all asses the English ass is the greatest.&nbsp; How conspicuous,
for instance, are those three young fellows sitting at the small
marble table in front of us.&nbsp; Most likely they are medical
students.&nbsp; Of course they are drinking and smoking, and have
female companions, respecting whose character there can be no
doubt.&nbsp; How happy are they in their conceit&mdash;in their
insolent laugh at the foreigners round them&mdash;in their vulgar
shouts of derisive applause.&nbsp; Talk to them, and you will be
astonished to find how morally dead they are, how narrow is their
range of thought, how obsolete are all their ideas, how
suppressed are all their sympathies: not even the beer they drink
can be heavier.&nbsp; Yet these lads are to teach the next age
its medical science&mdash;and in the last death-struggle, when we
would save the life we love, with broken hearts and streaming
eyes we shall appeal to them in vain.&nbsp; In England the
general practitioner will always be under-bred so long as the
night-house and the casino absorb the hours science imperiously
claims.&nbsp; But pass on to this next table.&nbsp; Look at this
girl all radiant with beauty and smiles&mdash;beautiful even in
spite of her long-lost virtue and life of sin.&nbsp; For,</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>&ldquo;You may break, you may ruin,
the vase if you will,<br />
But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man seated by her side is in love with her.&nbsp; It may
be for her love he has given up mother, sister, betrothed, home,
his fair name, his prospects in life, his hopes of heaven; and
she no more heeds his passionate vows than does the rock the
murmur of the waves at its feet; and already her wanton eye
glances round the room for other victims to sacrifice to her
vanity and pride.&nbsp; Oh, the deceit and craft and hardness of
women such as she!&nbsp; And yet on account of such in distant
village-homes there is sadness, and the mother and sister deny
themselves many a luxury, and grayhaired fathers mourn over their
lost and loved&mdash;their Benjamins&mdash;born and nurtured to
come to such an end.&nbsp; Perhaps at the next table the picture
is reversed; that woman is beautiful, and her face has a smile,
and there is a flush upon her cheek, and the wine has driven from
her heart for a while bitter memories; but she is not happy,
though loud be her laugh; and if she dared to sit and think of
the hour when she fell, and of the mire and dirt along which she
has crawled, of what she is now in her rustling silks, and what
she was in her peasant <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>dress
then&mdash;eyes full of grief, and dim with tears, would look
into her own; and out of that gilded room, and away from all the
song and laughter and wine, would she not rush home to die?&nbsp;
Yet if she now sells herself to pay to-morrow&rsquo;s
baker&rsquo;s bill, is she to be trod on by the high-born beauty
that goes up to God&rsquo;s altar with one for whom she has no
love, for an establishment that will make her bridesmaids yellow
with well-bred jealousy?&nbsp; But we are all gay here.&nbsp; Is
not the room light and cheerful?&nbsp; Is not the whole aspect
all mirth-inspiring?&nbsp; Does not dull care flee the flowing
bowl?&nbsp; Jolly fellows are sitting and telling each other
tales which you would be sorry your sister should hear, and which
no mother would believe would be ever heard by son of hers
without a manly protest.&nbsp; Women are laughing and drinking as
if theirs were not lives of shame.&nbsp; Sated men about town
languidly smoke, and the eye of the gloomy refugee sparkles, and
his heart beats quicker, as he hears the song of his
father-land.&nbsp; The hours hasten on&mdash;the company
depart&mdash;the wanton beauty, flushed with conquest, rides off
in the Hansom, or it may be in her private brougham, to her
luxurious rooms; while her sister, shivering <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>in the cold
night, begs us for two-pence with which to purchase a bed of
straw.&nbsp; Poor forlorn one! in another year thou wilt lie down
in another bed, only to wake up when the last trump shall
sound!</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt, Barry Cornwall, and the <i>Times</i> are all
eloquent in the praise of alcohol.&nbsp; It lifts us above this
dull earth, it fires our genius, it gives to us the large
utterances of the gods.&nbsp; Barry Cornwall tells us&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bad are the times<br />
And bad the rhymes<br />
That scorn old wine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leigh Hunt translates &ldquo;Bacchus in Tuscany,&rdquo; and
sanctions such lines as the following&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I would sooner take to poison<br />
Than a single cup set eyes on<br />
Of that bitter and guilty stuff ye<br />
Talk of by the name of coffee;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the <i>Times</i> everywhere inculcates the idea that,
without wine, poetry and eloquence and wit were dumb and
dead.&nbsp; Was Sidney Smith witty, was Shelley a poet, or was he
who in old times drew away the Hebrew multitude from the crowded
streets of Jerusalem out into the desert, <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>whose food
was locusts and wild honey, whose raiment was a leathern
girdle&mdash;was he not eloquent, as he warned the
terror-stricken mob that hung upon his lips of the wrath to
come?&nbsp; Facts are not in favour of the wine-drinkers.&nbsp;
Of Waller Dr Johnson writes, &ldquo;In a time when fancy and
gaiety were the most powerful recommendations to regard, it is
not likely that Waller was forgotten.&nbsp; He passed his time in
the company that was highest both in rank and wit, from which
even his obstinate sobriety did not exclude him.&nbsp; Though he
drank water, he was enabled by his fertility of mind to heighten
the mirth of Bacchanalian assemblies; and Mr Saville said that
&lsquo;no man in England should keep him company without
drinking, but Ned Waller.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In
Parliament,&rdquo; says Burnet, &ldquo;he was the delight of the
House, and, though old, said the liveliest things of any of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth is, men have often reserved the
outpourings of their mind for the social glass, and have fallen
into the natural mistake of believing that it was the glass, and
not the opportunity and the action of mind upon mind, that
elicited a certain amount of joyous fun.&nbsp; I must quote an
anecdote from Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s Life to illustrate <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>my meaning.&nbsp; He tells us one of his school-fellows
was always at the top of the class.&nbsp; Young Scott found that
when asked a question the lad alluded to was in the habit of
fumbling one peculiar button.&nbsp; Scott cut off that
button.&nbsp; The next time the poor fellow was asked a question,
as usual he put his hand to fumble the friendly
button&mdash;alas! it was gone, and with it his power, and he
speedily lost his place.&nbsp; The writers I have quoted, to be
consistent, should argue it was the button that made that lad
sharp and clever.</p>
<p>But if you still doubt, let us test the thing
practically.&nbsp; In Bolt-court, Fleet-street, there is a tavern
bearing the honoured name of Dr Johnson.&nbsp; Dr Johnson lived
in this court, and hence, I suppose, the sign; but the Doctor was
a total abstainer.&nbsp; He found he could not be a moderate
drinker, so he verily gave up the drink altogether.&nbsp; He told
that precious ass, Boswell, to drink water, because if he did
that he would be sure not to get drunk, whereas if he drank wine
he was not so sure; and Boswell, to whom the idea seems never to
have occurred, prints the remark as an astonishing instance of
his hero&rsquo;s sagacity.&nbsp; But I pass on to modern
times.&nbsp; In <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>this Dr Johnson&rsquo;s Tavern is
situated &ldquo;The City Concert Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose the
City does not care much about concerts, as <span class="smcap">I
</span>have generally found it very thinly attended.&nbsp; It is
a handsome room, and perhaps there are about fifty or sixty
gentlemen, chiefly young ones, present.&nbsp; You do not see
swells here as at Evans&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They are all very
plain-looking people, from the neighbouring shops, or from the
warehouses in Cheapside.&nbsp; Just by me are three pale
heavy-looking young men, whose intellects seem to me dead, except
so far as a low cunning indicates a sharpness where money is
concerned.&nbsp; One of them is stupidly beery.&nbsp; Their great
object is to get him to drink more, notwithstanding his repeated
assurances, uttered, however, in a very husky tone, that he must
go back to &ldquo;Islin&rsquo;ton&rdquo; to-night.&nbsp; A lady
at one end of the room, with a very handsome blue satin dress and
a very powerful voice, is screaming out something about
&ldquo;Lovely Spring,&rdquo; but this little party is evidently
indifferent to the charms of the song.&nbsp; Just beyond me is a
gent with a short pipe and a very stiff collar.&nbsp; I<span
class="smcap"> </span>watch him for an hour, and whether he is
enjoying himself intensely, or whether he is enduring an
indescribable amount of inward agony, I <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>cannot
tell.&nbsp; A little farther off is another gent with a very red
scarf, equally stoical in appearance.&nbsp; Behind me are two
verdant youths, of limited means I imagine; but they have the
pleasure of speaking to the comic singer, and take tickets for
that interesting gentleman&rsquo;s benefit.&nbsp; But the comic
singer comes forward, and sings with appropriate action of the
doings of a little insect very partial to comfortable
quarters.&nbsp; That song I have known fifteen years.&nbsp; I
have heard Sharp sing it, Ross sing it, Cowell sing it.&nbsp;
Night after night in some drinking room in some part of London or
other is a beery audience told&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Creeping where no life doth be,<br />
<span class="smcap">A </span>rare old plant is the lively
flea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And after a pursuit very vividly pantomimed, the little
stranger is suffered to be caught, and to tell the catcher that
it is his father&rsquo;s ghost, doomed for a season to walk the
earth and nip him most infernally, and so on.&nbsp; Now I am sure
that every one in the room has heard this dozens of times before,
yet old men are laughing as if it was an absolute novelty.&nbsp;
Talk about alcohol brightening men&rsquo;s intellects!&nbsp; When
I come to such places as this, it always seems <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>to me to
have a precisely contrary effect.&nbsp; Men could not sit and
hear all these stale witticisms unless they drank.&nbsp; Sober, I
am sure they could not do it, not even if they were paid for it;
and yet all seem enraptured.&nbsp; I remark, however, one
exception.&nbsp; Two waiters help to a seat by my side a very
dirty little man with red eyes, and generally shabby
appearance.&nbsp; The waiters set down by him a glass of grog,
offer him a cigar, and then playfully shaking their fingers at
him, as if to intimate he had better be quiet, leave him to his
fate.&nbsp; After a few minutes of deep thought, he looks to me
and beckons.&nbsp; I take no notice.&nbsp; He repeats the
signal.&nbsp; I lean forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very o-old, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; we ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The comic singer very o-old, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We intimate as much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But get him on a fresh piece, sir, and see how he can
go-o.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here our friend began rolling one arm rapidly
round the other, to give us an idea of the comic singer&rsquo;s
powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity he don&rsquo;t give something new,&rdquo; repeats
our friend.&nbsp; Another assenting nod on our part and the
conversation ceases.&nbsp; But we suppose it <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>is with
comic singers as with others.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man who has settled
his opinions does not love to have the tranquillity of his
convictions disturbed,&rdquo; wrote Dr Johnson, and a comic
singer does not like to have the bother of learning fresh
songs.&nbsp; But the comic singer was applauded and encored, and
then he treated us to a monologue, in which he describes how he,
the drunken husband, stays out all night, and makes it up with
his &ldquo;old ooman&rdquo; when he gets home; and in the course
of his remarks of course he declares teetotalism is humbug, that
there was truth in wine, but he&rsquo;d be blessed if there was
any in water; that the man who would drink the latter would be a
muddy cistern&mdash;forgetting all the while the <i>tu quoque</i>
the water-drinkers would very fairly urge, on the authority even
of Mr Henry Drummond; and then I came away, thinking that if
drinking made men witty and light-hearted, I had been very
unfortunate on the night of my visit.&nbsp; Once upon a time, as
the writer was in the Cave of Harmony, the polite manager asked
him his opinion of a new comic singer.&nbsp; Having given it, the
red-faced little man turned to us with a sigh, and said,
&ldquo;Ah, sir, you have no idea what a dearth there is <!-- page
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>of
comic talent now-a-days.&rdquo;&nbsp; And truly he was
right.&nbsp; There is little fun and comedy and wit
anywhere.&nbsp; I know not where they are; I know where they are
not.&nbsp; You will not find them in the taverns where men sit
all the evening listening to music for which they do not care,
and drinking all the while.&nbsp; How should there be, since wine
is now admitted to be the product of the laboratory, not of the
grape?</p>
<h2><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>THE SPORTING PUBLIC-HOUSE</h2>
<p>Was instituted for the combined purpose of encouraging
drinking, and what its admirers term the noble art of
self-defence.&nbsp; There was a time when boxing was in fashion;
when but few of our noblemen and gentlemen did not take lessons
in the pugilistic art.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">I</span>
can assert, without fear of contradiction,&rdquo; writes Pierce
Egan, &ldquo;that <span class="smcap">I</span> furnished the
present Duke of Buccleuch with a pair of boxing-gloves and all
the volumes of &lsquo;Boxiana&rsquo; during his studies at Eton
College.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prince George of Cambridge learnt the
rudiments of the art from young Richmond; the late Duke of
Portland was a pupil of that Jackson whose name is familiar to
all readers of Byron.&nbsp; At the first public dinner of the
Pugilistic Society, held at the Thatched House Tavern, 1814, a
baronet, Sir Henry Smith, was in the chair; and it is a fact,
when the war with France was terminated, and the Emperor of
Russia and the King of Prussia, <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>accompanied
by Blucher and Platoff, visited this country, that not anything
they had witnessed appeared to interest them more than the
sparring matches between Jackson, Tom Crib, Belcher, Old Dutch
Sam, at a <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> given by Lord Lowther at his
mansion.&nbsp; Indeed, so delighted were those great masters of
the art of war with the combats between those first-rate boxers,
that Messrs Blucher and Platoff had a second exhibition by their
own express desire at the Earl of Elgin&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
Actually even in the House of Commons Mr Wyndham favoured the
House with a description, warm and glowing, of a recent contest
between Richmond and Maddox, of which he had been a spectator;
and it is not long since Mr Gully, a prize-fighter, represented
Pontefract.&nbsp; The late George IV., when Prince of Wales, was
also a spectator at the fight upon a stage on Brighton Downs
between Tom Tyne, a distinguished boxer, with a publican of
milling notoriety.&nbsp; The latter was killed by a blow on his
temple, and died almost upon the instant.&nbsp; The royal
debauchee never attended another, but his brother, the late
William the Fourth, was often a spectator of the matches on
Moulsey Hurst.&nbsp; In this respect the age has made
progress.&nbsp; <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Our noblemen no longer patronize the
prize-ring.&nbsp; Our young princes have a purer taste.&nbsp; Yet
the institution, with all its brutality and blackguardism, still
exists, and in the <i>Advertiser</i>, side by side with an
article bewailing the spread of German neology in our dissenting
colleges, or speaking evil of such earnest workers in the wide
field of philanthropy as Maurice or Kingsley, you will read of
one of the beastly prize-fights which still disgrace the
land.&nbsp; But the <i>Advertiser</i> is the publicans&rsquo;
paper, and it is a fact easily understood, that the
prize-fighter, when his day is over, generally keeps a
public-house, which is generally called a sporting-house.&nbsp; A
warm admirer of them writes, &ldquo;Fun, civility, mirth,
good-humour, and sporting events are the general theme of
conversation to be met with over a cheerful glass at the above
houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben Caunt&rsquo;s, in St
Martin&rsquo;s-lane, is perhaps the principal one, but there are
some five or six besides in various parts of the
metropolis.&nbsp; Let us enter one.&nbsp; In spite of the
assurance of civility and good humour, I don&rsquo;t think you
will stay long, but will feel on a small scale what Daniel must
have felt in the lions&rsquo; den.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>We enter, we will say, Bang Up&rsquo;s hostelry, about
ten on a Thursday evening; there is Bang Up at the bar, with his
ton of flesh and broken nose.&nbsp; Many people think it worth
while to go and spend one or two shillings at Bang Up&rsquo;s
bar, merely that they may have the pleasure of seeing him, and
consider him cheap at the money.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t admire their
taste.&nbsp; I once spent an evening with the Norfolk Giant, and
I did not find him very witty or well informed.&nbsp; But let us
walk up-stairs, having first paid sixpence to a doorkeeper, by
appearance a negro, for which we are to receive a certain amount
of refreshment, if beer and grog come rightly under that
denomination; at length we find ourselves in a very ordinary
room, with very extraordinary people in it.&nbsp; First, there
are the portraits&mdash;<i>imprimis</i> Bang Up, looking grosser
and more animal than ever.&nbsp; Secondly, Mrs Bang Up, the exact
counterpart of her bosom&rsquo;s lord; then a tribe of Bang Ups
junior, of all sizes and sexes, attract our astonished
eyes.&nbsp; Then&mdash;for the room is a complete
Walhalla&mdash;we have portraits of sporting heroes innumerable,
with villanous foreheads, all &ldquo;vacant of our glorious
gains,&rdquo; heavy eyes, thick bull necks, <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and very
short croppy hair.&nbsp; Here Gully vanquishes Bob Gregson,
&ldquo;the Lancashire champion,&rdquo; one of the finest and most
formidable men of the day.&nbsp; There Jack Randall and Ned
Turner display &ldquo;a fine science and capital fighting,&rdquo;
almost unparalleled, and so on; for the list is long, and it is
one we do not care to repeat.&nbsp; We seat ourselves at the
further end of the room, with a few gentlemen drinking gin and
smoking cigars.&nbsp; Twenty or thirty mean-looking men are
seated along the side; they are mostly dirty, and have broken
noses; they are not very conversational, but seem chiefly to be
deeply engaged in smoking.&nbsp; At length the waiter brings out
some boxing gloves; one man takes off his coat and waistcoat,
possibly his shirt, and puts them on; another does the
same&mdash;they stand up to each other, the gents at the table
encourage them, and the seedy men with broken noses look on very
knowingly; they spar for some time, till the one feels that he
cannot touch the other, and throws down the gloves; a small
collection is then made for the noble art of self-defence, which,
I presume, is divided amongst the performers; other actors come
upon the stage, and the friendly contests are maintained <!--
page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>till Bang Up closes his public-house for the
night.&nbsp; As I came out, it was a great consolation to me to
think that there are not many such places in London.&nbsp; The
style of men thus created are, I fear, neither useful nor
ornamental.&nbsp; They have a nasty ticket-of-leave look, and I
would fain dispense with their company in quiet back streets
during the small hours.&nbsp; One other thought may console you;
the sporting public-house, once popular, now attracts but a few,
and that few a weak and vicious class.&nbsp; Is not this matter
of encouragement?</p>
<h2><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>THE PUBLIC-HOUSE WITH A
BILLIARD-ROOM</h2>
<p>Is a great attraction in some places.&nbsp; We knew a whole
town upset by the fact that the landlord of the
&ldquo;Swan&rdquo; had fitted up a billiard-room.&nbsp; I and
Wiggins and Foley and Jobson spent at one time, I regret to say,
a good deal of time there.&nbsp; I am warning the reader against
the follies of my youth; but Foley failed, and Jobson and
Wiggins, after having had their debts paid three or four times by
their friends, I believe are now following that eminently healthy
occupation called gold-digging, somewhere in Australia.&nbsp;
Then I think of that little town in South Wales, and of the
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; under whose too hospitable roof we used to
meet.&nbsp; One of us was an M.P&rsquo;s son; he is now, I
believe, dragging down a father&rsquo;s grey hairs with sorrow to
the grave.&nbsp; Another of us bore a name dear to every
Englishman; he, I believe, is pensioned off by his family, and
lives as he can on the <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>handsome
allowance of a guinea a-week.&nbsp; But these London
billiard-rooms are fifty times more pernicious.&nbsp; There are
some five or six hundred connected with public-houses.&nbsp;
There are in all our large thoroughfares separate rooms licensed
for this game, but at these drinking often goes on.&nbsp; And
thus the two excitements acting on the man, he is impelled
downwards with an increasing power.&nbsp; I have seen in these
rooms officers and secretaries of public companies in a night
losing, I am sure, a quarter&rsquo;s salary; I have seen young
fellows completely ruined.&nbsp; There was not, when I first knew
him, a more promising, gentlemanly young fellow than Smethwicke,
and now, they tell me, he is in Marylebone Workhouse.</p>
<p>We are told that men are grown-up children.&nbsp; This saying
forcibly occurred to me the last time I was in a
billiard-room.&nbsp; After I had recovered from the feeling of
suffocation which an atmosphere infected by gas and smoke had
produced, I observed a number of men with long sticks trying to
knock a number of various-coloured balls into any of the six
pockets of the billiard-table.&nbsp; At each unsuccessful attempt
a chorus of observations were made by the players, not <!-- page
139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>remarkable for their novelty, for the vocabulary of the
billiard-room is very limited, such as &ldquo;Not within a
mile&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t play for you,
Bob&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It smelt the hole,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp; At each successful attempt the chorus was still
more animated, but not more original, as &ldquo;Good
stroke,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Bad flewke&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;On the
red,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The game that was being played
was called &ldquo;pool.&rdquo;&nbsp; A number of people put each
2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i>, as they may choose to arrange it, and
they have each a ball of a different colour&mdash;red, blue,
pink, yellow, white, brown, black.&nbsp; Each player has what is
called three lives, and each time he is put in by a
player&mdash;for they play in turn&mdash;he pays sixpence or a
shilling, according to arrangement, and loses a life, whilst the
successful player is allowed to play again upon the ball which
happens to be nearest.&nbsp; The money in the pool is ultimately
divided between the two players who have kept their three lives
the longest.&nbsp; It will be seen that, if everything is
straightforward, the best player has the best chance of dividing
the pool or taking the lives.&nbsp; But, unhappily, this game, so
child-like in appearance, is not always innocent.&nbsp; It may
happen two players, gifted by nature with conveniently elastic
consciences, <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>and a very confused notion of right
and wrong, may arrange when they play upon each other to
purposely avoid putting the ball in.&nbsp; Of course, each time
this omission is made it is equal to the owner of the ball having
an extra life, and of course makes the division of the pool
almost a certainty.&nbsp; Perhaps at the end of the evening the
two gentlemen, &ldquo;who merely play for their amusement,&rdquo;
may be seen under a lamppost dividing the spoil.&nbsp; The other
games are pyramids and billiards, which it is unnecessary to
describe.&nbsp; I will simply remark that the best player should
win the game; but this is not always the case.&nbsp; Alas! for
human nature!&nbsp; Sharps lose to win; muffs win to lose (the
term &ldquo;muff&rdquo; is applied to an indifferent
player).&nbsp; After this not very flattering description the
reader would doubtless like to know who frequent these
places.&nbsp; A very large majority are gentlemen&mdash;men who
are perfectly incapable of doing anything but what is strictly
honest; the minority are billiard sharks.&nbsp; The gentlemen
play because it is a source of excitement; the sharks, because it
is a source of profit.&nbsp; There are also some who play only
for amusement with gentlemen like themselves, and never risk
beyond <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>a shilling or so; and others, mere
lookers-on, who, fatigued by their daily labours, prefer a
<i>dolce far niente</i> to the trouble of theatres, &amp;c., and
who read the paper, drink their brandy and water, and smoke their
cigar, without either playing or making a bet.</p>
<p>It is not easier to distinguish a gentleman in a billiard-room
than elsewhere, but without wishing to be personal, it is
desirable the stranger should keep at a distance those
individuals who are so very familiar and friendly with every one,
and who keep a piece of chalk in their waistcoat pocket.&nbsp;
These people cannot be insulted; they carefully avoid squabbles,
which may bring about disagreeable insinuations; they prefer
pursuing the even tenor of their way, &ldquo;picking up&rdquo; as
many people as they can.&nbsp; See yonder old man who totters
across the room; his trade is swindling, his goods are lies, his
recreation is obscenity and blasphemy; his palsied hand can
scarcely grasp a cue, and yet there are few who can excel him; by
concealing his game carefully he has won, and can win hundreds,
from his victims, who, thinking nothing of his skill, are
astonished, as he pretends to be himself, at his
<i>luck</i>.&nbsp; The young wife tossing restlessly in her <!--
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>bed, and wondering what can keep her lord so long at
<i>business</i>, little knows, when he returns home flushed and
excited, that he has been fleeced of money he can ill afford to
lose; whilst the sharer of the domestic joys of the billiard
shark basks in the sunshine of his momentary good humour, as he
displays with a sardonic smile the gold which perhaps never
belonged to the dupe who lost it.&nbsp; But the night is closing
on us; we have seen enough for once.&nbsp; Come away.</p>
<h2><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>THE RESPECTABLE PUBLIC-HOUSE</h2>
<p>Is situated in one of the leading thoroughfares, and is
decorated in an exceedingly handsome manner.&nbsp; The furniture
is all new and beautifully polished, the seats are generally
exquisitely soft and covered with crimson velvet, the walls are
ornamented with pictures and pier-glasses, and the ceiling is
adorned in a manner costly and rare.&nbsp; Such places as
Simpson&rsquo;s or Campbell&rsquo;s in Beak-street, or Nell
Gwynn&rsquo;s, almost rival the clubs, and, indeed, are much
smarter than anything they can show at the Milton.&nbsp; Time was
when men were partial to the sanded floor, the plain furniture,
the homely style of such places as Dolly&rsquo;s, the London
Coffee-house, or the Cock, to which Tennyson has lent the glory
of his name.&nbsp; Now the love of show is cultivated to an
alarming extent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us be genteel or die,&rdquo;
said Mrs Nickleby, and her spirit surrounds us everywhere.&nbsp;
Hence the splendour of the drinking-rooms of the metropolis, <!--
page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>and the studied deportment of the waiters, and the
subdued awe with which Young Norvals fresh from the Grampian
Hills and their fathers&rsquo; flocks tread the costly carpets or
sprawl their long legs beneath glittering mahogany.</p>
<p>Let us suppose it is about nine or ten in the evening, and we
step into one of the numerous establishments which are to the
respectable classes what the gin-palace and the beer-house is
supposed to be to the class who are not.&nbsp; The reader must
pardon my use of the word respectable.&nbsp; It is a word which,
from my heart, I abhor, and, as it is commonly employed, merely
denotes that a man has an account at a bank.&nbsp; There are but
two ways in which human actions can be contemplated&mdash;the
worldly and the philosophical or Christian.&nbsp; I use the term
respectable merely in its worldly acceptation, but I skip this
digression and pass on.&nbsp; Undoubtedly at the first blush it
is a cheerful scene that first meets our eye.&nbsp; In this box
are two or three old friends discussing a bottle of claret, who
have not met perhaps since bright and boisterous boyhood, and who
may never meet again.&nbsp; Of what manly struggle, of what
sorrow that can never die, of what calm pleasures and chastened
hopes, have <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>they to tell!&nbsp; No wonder that
you see the tear glistening in the eye, though there is laughter
on the lip.&nbsp; Pass on; here are some bagsmen red with port,
and redolent of slang.&nbsp; In the next box are three or four
young fellows drinking whisky and smoking cigars, and of course
their talk is of wine and women; but there is hope, nevertheless,
for woman is still to them a something divine, and the evil days
have not come when they see in her nothing but common clay.&nbsp;
Look at this retired old gentleman of the old school sitting by
himself alone; yet is he not alone, for as he sips his port
memories thicken in his brain, of ancient cronies now sleeping in
churchyards far away, of a sainted wife no longer a denizen of
this dark world of sin, of daughters with laughing children round
their knees, all rosy and chubby and flaxen-haired, of sons with
Anglo-Saxon energy and faith planting the old race on a new
soil.&nbsp; Cross to this other side and look at these reckless,
dissipated fellows, whom the waiter has just respectfully
requested not to make so much noise, as it disturbs the other
gentlemen in the room.&nbsp; Possibly they are Joint Stock Bank
directors or railway officials, and after a few years it will be
found that for their revelry to-night <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>a deluded
public will have to pay.&nbsp; Here are a host of city merchants
discussing politics, and it is wonderful how common-place is
their conversation under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palmerston is a great man, by ---, he is a great man,
sir,&rdquo; says one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, and no mistake,&rdquo; is
the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no humbug about
Palmerston,&rdquo; says another.&nbsp; And so they ring the
changes, originating nothing, gaining nothing, only getting
redder in the face and more indistinct in their
pronunciation.&nbsp; At length they button over their great
coats, pay their bills, and generally very good-naturedly, but
very unsteadily, steer towards the door.&nbsp; It may be that a
noisy discussion takes place.&nbsp; One man a little more gone
than the rest disturbs the harmony of the evening by his flat
contradictions, uttered somewhat too rudely, and backed by a blow
from the fist on the table, which breaks a couple of
glasses.&nbsp; But next morning he apologizes; &ldquo;It was only
my wine contradicting your wine,&rdquo; he says, without any
sense of shame.&nbsp; But this rarely happens.&nbsp; The
respectable classes have more command of their temper, and do not
get so idiotically drunk as the frequenters of low public-houses,
and so the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> are in no <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>hurry to
move and leave the light and luxurious room for the muddy streets
and the winter night.&nbsp; But they must do so, and young men
with their passions unnaturally stimulated, and the conscience
proportionately deadened, are left to the temptations which await
men who are out in the small hours; and old fogies, believing
that if they go to bed mellow, they live as they ought to live,
and die jolly fellows, find their way to their respective
dwelling-places in a state as lamentable as it is
degrading.&nbsp; Yet next Sunday you will see these men at
church, and hear them joining in solemn and contrite
prayer.&nbsp; Do they think these purple faces tell no
tales?&nbsp; Do they think it is only the wife knows how they
drink&mdash;in respectable company&mdash;in respectable
hotels?&nbsp; Do they forget that in the midst of their revelry,
under the flaming chandeliers, peering over the shoulders of
courteous waiters, listening to their vinous laughter and ancient
jokes, Death, with his dart, is there?&nbsp; Ay, and one night he
will ride home with his victim in the Hansom, and will see him
placed, all smelling with drink and under its influence, in the
bed, side by side with his wife, and next morning she will as
usual give her husband the seidlitz powder or soda <!-- page
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>water, and leave him to sleep for a short while longer,
and when she comes back will find that his is the sleep which
knows no waking.&nbsp; And then the inquest will be
held&mdash;and a medical man will perplex a plain case with
useless show of knowledge, and a jury will return a verdict of
&ldquo;Death from natural causes.&rdquo;&nbsp; You and I know
better&mdash;you and I know that if the man had not gone into the
respectable public-house he might have lived another ten
years&mdash;that it was because he went there night after night,
and sat soaking there night after night, that the blood-vessels
became gorged and clotted, and that the wonderful machine stood
still.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poisoned by alcohol&rdquo; is the true
verdict&mdash;by alcohol sold and consumed in the respectable
public-house.&nbsp; How long will society sanction such
places?&nbsp; How long will they retard the progress of the
nation by wasting energies, and time, and cash, and opportunities
that might have been devoted to nobler ends?&nbsp; How long with
their splendour&mdash;with their gilding and glass&mdash;with
their air of respectability and comfort, will they attract the
unwary, ruin the weak, and slay the strong man in his strength
and pride?</p>

<p>Plutarch begins one of those biographies which in all times
have been the charm of childhood and age, by remarking that,
&ldquo;If things are implicated in a dependence upon definite
numbers, it is a necessity that the same things must often
happen, being effected by the same means.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus is
it, life in all its broad aspects is everywhere the same.&nbsp;
All over the globe there is a wonderful uniformity in human
habits.&nbsp; Men who work hard&mdash;as a rule&mdash;rise early,
and go to bed early.&nbsp; Night is the time for rest.&nbsp; So
far at least there is harmony between God&rsquo;s law and
man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The men and women who transgress are for the
most part waifs and strays.&nbsp; Such are the denizens of our
streets by night&mdash;such are they who crowd, not alone the
night public-houses, but night coffee-houses of our
metropolis.</p>
<p>Here in London these houses are of all kinds.&nbsp; For
instance, let us enter one in the Haymarket.&nbsp; <!-- page
150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>The rooms are as smart as gilding and ornamented paper
and plate-glass can make them.&nbsp; The waiters are got up
regardless of expense.&nbsp; The coffee is good, but dear.&nbsp;
The men and women are of the kind usually met with in this
locality during the small hours.&nbsp; The greater part are fools
enough to think it worth while to buy a little worldly wisdom at
a price&mdash;it may be at the loss of their bodies and
souls&mdash;none but madmen would think of paying.&nbsp; In such
places as these you are as sure to be injured as if you sat all
night carousing in a public-house.&nbsp; These women with forced
smiles on their painted cheeks are the veritable Harpies.&nbsp;
Theirs is the true sardonic laugh.&nbsp; Do you remember one way
in which that ancient phrase is accounted for?&nbsp; Sardinia, it
was said, was noted for a bitter herb which contracted the
features of those who tasted it.&nbsp; Pausanias says it is a
plant like parsley, which grows near springs, and causes people
who eat it to laugh till they die; and these women, have they not
eaten a bitter plant, and do they not laugh and die?&nbsp; Beware
of the women.&nbsp; Beware of the men.&nbsp; See how their
cunning eyes glisten if you change a sovereign.&nbsp; If they can
get you into a neighbouring <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>public-house and rob you, they will be rather pleased
than otherwise.&nbsp; Look at that tall dark fellow watching
us.&nbsp; It was only the other day he met a man here, as he
might you or I, and decoyed him into a public-house close by,
where his confederates were waiting, and robbed him of forty
pounds when they thought their victim was sufficiently
&ldquo;fuddled&rdquo; with champagne.&nbsp; He and such as he are
not particular who they rob.&nbsp; They do not spare the women, I
assure you.</p>
<p>Let us now turn towards Covent-garden.&nbsp; The debauchery of
Covent-garden is not what it was.&nbsp; Obscenity is banished
from the Cave of Harmony, and better hours are kept; but there
are night coffee-houses about here, dirty, shabby places,
patronised by dirty, shabby people.&nbsp; How weary and wayworn
are the women!&nbsp; They have been walking the streets for
hours&mdash;they have been dancing in neighbouring
saloons&mdash;they have paraded their meretricious charms, and
here they sit, hungry, tired, sleepy, and &rsquo;t is three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; No home have they to go to
but some wretched room for which they pay a sum equal to the
entire rent of the house.&nbsp; There is little gaiety here; the
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>poor comic nigger, with his banjo and his double
entendre playing with all his might, in the hope that some gent
will stand a cup of coffee and a muffin, can scarce raise a
laugh.&nbsp; Timidly one asks, &ldquo;Will you treat me to a cup
of coffee, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, forlorn one.&nbsp; If your sin
is great, so is your punishment; once you might have been a
dainty little wife, and now what are you?&nbsp; I say it
sorrowfully, the scum of the streets, garbage for drunken
lust.</p>
<p>Let us go a little further on, not into that house, there are
only thieves and pickpockets there, and we might be bullied,
which is not pleasant.&nbsp; Ah, here&rsquo;s the house we are
looking for; it has done a good trade this many a year, for is
there not a cab-stand opposite, and cabby knows the value of a
cup of coffee on a cold winter&rsquo;s night.&nbsp; Never mind
the smell; as business is carried on uninterruptedly during the
twenty-four hours, and as the company belongs to that part of the
population not guilty of an inordinate attachment to soap and
water, and to whom cheap baths are a myth, it cannot be matter of
surprise if there be about the place &ldquo;an ancient and
fish-like smell.&rdquo;&nbsp; But here comes the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good morning, gents;&rdquo; <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>in an under
voice, &ldquo;you had better mind your pocket; there are some
strange characters here.&nbsp; A cup of coffee?&nbsp; Yes,
sir.&nbsp; Now then, sir, you had better wake up, it is time for
you to be off.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had a good hour&rsquo;s
sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not let him sleep?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, you see, sir, such fellows would stay here all night
and fill up the house, and not spend a penny; and business is
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; A curious medley is here of sleepy,
half-tipsy, sickly unfortunates.&nbsp; Yet even here the line is
drawn; the door opens, and we dimly discern a mass of rags; so
does our landlord, as he rushes to exclude the would-be
customer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, you are trying it on again, are you?
you know you can&rsquo;t come here.&nbsp; Why, you see, sir, if
we let such fellows in, the place would swarm with&mdash;,&rdquo;
(the reader must supply the blank).&nbsp; But we take the hint,
and not unreluctantly depart.</p>
<p>The night public-house has, I confess,&mdash;and I am glad to
do so,&mdash;lost somewhat of its popularity in latter
years.&nbsp; At one time it was common everywhere; now it is in
only a few streets that it exists and pollutes the
atmosphere.&nbsp; In the Strand, in the Haymarket, in
Oxford-street, night-houses were numerous; but the one to which I
more immediately refer was situated in <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>the
neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road.&nbsp; Since then, Mr
Spurgeon has been preaching in that locality, but I dare say the
night-house exists nevertheless.</p>
<p>Let us suppose it is about two in the morning, and with the
exception of one or two amiable garotters, a few sleepy police,
and some three or four women, the regular population of the
neighbourhood may be safely considered to have been long in
bed.&nbsp; The gas-lamps shine almost exclusively on
yourself.&nbsp; You look up at the windows and you see no lights
save where, perhaps, poverty may be stitching for bread, or where
Death may have come an unbidden guest and borne away the fairest
and the best beloved.&nbsp; At this hour the young bride in all
her beauty may be struck down in mortal agony, or the wee pet
lamb, whose little silver laugh had so often dispelled the dark
cloud that gathered round the home, or the grey-haired man,
having just reached the goal, and achieved an independence, may
find himself left in this bleak, dark, wide world alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Leaves have their time to fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flowers to wither at the north wind&rsquo;s
breath,<br />
And stars to set; but all&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>And now let us forget all this, and knock at this door,
above which streams a mellow light, and from which we hear sounds
of boisterous gaiety.&nbsp; Is it not open yet?&nbsp; Then give
another rap.&nbsp; Ah, it is all right now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
care of your pockets,&rdquo; says Cerberus, in a low
voice,&mdash;&ldquo;there are some rum blokes here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We will, my friend.</p>
<p>Yes, they must be rum blokes who come here into this filthy,
stinking shop, and amongst this filthy, ragged, swearing crew of
reprobates.&nbsp; If you wish to see a set of fellows whose mere
looks would hang them, I think they are about us now.&nbsp; Even
the landlord seems uncomfortable in their presence, and wisely
allows as little as possible of temptation in his house or on his
person.&nbsp; He knows, I believe, they would as soon rob him as
any one else, and his small ferrety eyes are evidently wide
awake.&nbsp; Indeed, none of the party look as if they had much
honest sleep, and in the daylight, I imagine, would present a
somewhat seedy appearance.&nbsp; We generally think cabmen not
scrupulously honest, but perhaps these cabmen, with ancient great
coats and well muffled up, are the honestest fellows here.&nbsp;
Then of course there is an Irish &ldquo;widder,&rdquo; with <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>melancholy face and a string of ballads, such as
&ldquo;Mary Blane,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Red, White, and Blue,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cheer, boys, cheer,&rdquo; all of which she is willing to
dispose of on the most reasonable terms.&nbsp; A decayed swell,
probably a railway director in the great year of bubbles, with
extraordinary sponges&mdash;an article I should have thought
quite as unsaleable as soap to the
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i>,&mdash;and a jockey-like looking person
with knives with most wonderful and unaccountable blades, or with
some fancy work-boxes or other articles equally ingenious and
useless.&nbsp; Women are here, of course, in the last stage of
their profligate career, driven out of decent houses, unfit to
associate with the well-dressed and the young&mdash;wrinkled,
repulsive, red.&nbsp; As you see them drink, quarrelling,
screaming, and cursing, as they always do till turned out to go
God knows where, can you imagine that the difference between them
and your own mother is merely that of circumstance, and
education, and habit?&mdash;perhaps merely the difference
produced by drink.&nbsp; I can tell you that little hag was once
a rich man&rsquo;s leman, and robed herself in silk and satin,
and quaffed her costly wine; and now hark how piteously she begs
a drop of gin, ere she staggers <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>to her
wretched garret and straw to dream of a youth and gaiety now no
longer hers.&nbsp; Here she has warmth, light, and society, and
the night-house exists for such as she; and if, as is quite as
likely as not, she is in league with some of the men around us,
here she brings her victim, and then, stupified by drink, she has
only to decoy him down some dark passage, and he becomes an easy
prey to the sneaking thief who comes skulking up behind.&nbsp;
But let us listen&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and my pal we was a-going along the Hedgware-road,
and we sor&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; is the courteous reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by making all this row?&rdquo; cries
the landlord, with a horrid oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, old buffer, another quartern of
gin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a screw of tobacco, master, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old gal, what&rsquo;ll you drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind, what&rsquo;ll you
stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we has arf and arf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the hours pass, and the place gets hotter, and stinks
more and more every hour, for the men and women have not a very
pleasant <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>effluvium, and the hubbub becomes
more intense.&nbsp; You tell me you would rather not stay here
long.&nbsp; Well, I am quite of your opinion, for a couple of
gentlemen with pale faces have been eyeing us most attentively
ever since we have been here, and I confess their appearance is
not prepossessing.&nbsp; Their short hair seems to indicate an
acquaintance with one of the public establishments of the
metropolis, with whose inmates it is not well to be too
familiar.&nbsp; They are dressed in fustian, with thick boots
well studded with nails, a kick from which on the head when a man
is down would soon settle his business; and with their
close-fitting caps, Belcher handkerchiefs, and heavy animal
faces, are certainly not very pleasant-looking young men.&nbsp; I
should be sorry to intimate my suspicions to them, as they may be
noblemen in disguise, and might feel hurt at my want of
charity.&nbsp; In the mean while, as the door is being opened and
the coast is clear, I avail myself of the opportunity, and
leaving the night-house, am soon dreaming in my feverish slumber
that I have just been garotted and left for dead at the door of
my domestic establishment, to the intense agony of my wife and
children,&mdash;of course, by the two amiable young <!-- page
159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>people aforesaid,&mdash;and I feel for some days after
as if I had suffered terribly from a species of night-mare.&nbsp;
So hideous is the life, so degraded the company, so revolting are
the scenes, at these night-houses, I know not why the law permits
them to be open.&nbsp; I am sure they can answer no good or moral
end.&nbsp; Mr Norton, a few days since, said, in deciding a case
at the Lambeth police-office, he hoped a law would soon be passed
to close night-houses.&nbsp; On this head the police magistrates
are unanimous.</p>
<h2><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>HIGHBURY BARN.</h2>
<p>A writer<span class="smcap"> </span>in <i>Chambers&rsquo;s
Journal</i> some time since called attention to the peculiar
attractions of Highbury Barn.&nbsp; What are these
attractions?&nbsp; I confess that the place has connected it with
the eating and drinking associations of years; that here
generations of cockneys have dined; that here, Sunday after
Sunday, they have come to drink bottled stout and smoke; that it
is extensively patronized by shopmen and milliners; that the
society is not of the most refined order; and that the love made
in it is not of the noblest and purest character.&nbsp; I cannot
understand how <i>Chambers</i> could have been got to puff up
such a place to the public.&nbsp; I am sure the decent public
will not thank <i>Chambers</i> for the puff.</p>
<p>Highbury Barn is an admirable illustration of the way in which
Acts of Parliament are evaded.&nbsp; In 1852 Mr Hinton applied
for and obtained a license for music, and he stated in his
petition on that occasion, that his object was to have the <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>license as an adjunct to dinner-parties, a great number
of which were held there; and at that time he had no idea
whatever of having dancing in the place.&nbsp; In 1854, however,
a different state of things arose, and, from a combination of
causes, the parties and festivals at Highbury Barn fell off, and
competition was so great, that Mr Hinton, having a large
establishment, in which a great deal of capital was invested, was
compelled to do something to meet the public taste, as he says,
or, as I might say, to create it.&nbsp; Accordingly, on Whit
Monday of that year, he opened his establishment for musical
entertainments with the band of the Grenadier Guards.&nbsp; This
was considered by the magistrates as an infraction of his
agreement with them, and his license was refused.&nbsp; But Mr
Hinton was not beaten; he had his large capital invested, and
somehow or other the public must be got into his house.&nbsp; An
ingenious plan was devised, by which Mr Hinton was enabled to
carry on his music and dancing without a license, and yet be
secure from the penalties incurred by the breakers of law.&nbsp;
There is an assembly called Almack&rsquo;s, frequented by the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of the land, held in Willis&rsquo;s
Rooms.&nbsp; Those rooms are not <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>licensed
according to Act of Parliament, yet all the leaders of <i>bon
ton</i> there congregate, and they would be liable to be taken up
as rogues and vagabonds under the Act.&nbsp; But the dancing is
carried on there by an association, under the auspices of which
tickets are sold.&nbsp; Well, Mr Hinton adopted a similar
plan.&nbsp; The Highbury Club was formed, and the club kindly
provided the youthful votaries of pleasure with the desired
amusement.&nbsp; If we are to believe Mr Hinton, the result has
not been very advantageous, as his receipts on the sale of
alcoholic liquors fell off &pound;600&mdash;a statement rather
difficult to reconcile with his former one, that he found his
customers had left him, and that he must do something to call
them back.&nbsp; Be that as it may, Mr Hinton has now his
license, though three clergymen connected with the district
concurred in stating that parties on leaving the Barn were
disorderly and riotous, and disturbed the quiet of the locality,
and that the licensing of that establishment would have a very
demoralizing effect.</p>
<p>And now let us go to Highbury Barn.&nbsp; As we walk alone
Highbury-place, we pass by many a father of a family grumbling at
the idea of having <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>his quiet invaded by parties coming
home from the Barn; and yet there was a time, probably, when he
heard the chimes at midnight; and the chances are, so wretchedly
are our lads educated, that while the father is at home reading
his religious magazine, the son is being initiated into fast life
at the Barn.&nbsp; But on we go through a dark passage, admirably
adapted for a garotte walk, till we come to the place of
rendezvous.&nbsp; We pay sixpence and walk in.&nbsp; The first
thing that strikes us is the Master of the Ceremonies.&nbsp; We
are amazed,&mdash;in the distant West never have we met a more
distinguished swell.&nbsp; His attitude is faultless; his raven
hair is parted in the middle; his dark eye is turned in a
languishing manner upward to the orchestra.&nbsp; In the
intervals between the dances he walks up and down the room in an
abstract and poetic manner, and Melancholy marks him for her
own.&nbsp; You believe in the doctrine of metamorphoses as you
look at him.&nbsp; He is a star fallen upon evil days.&nbsp;
Beneath that faultless black dress-coat there lies the soul of a
Beau Brummel or a Nash.&nbsp; Well, then, may there be a tinge of
sadness on his cheek, and a cloud upon his brow.&nbsp; But let us
leave him awhile and look about us.&nbsp; What <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>a noble
room! we shall not see a finer one in London.&nbsp; At one end is
a gallery; at the other a raised platform with very comfortable
seats and tables.&nbsp; All round the room are illustrations of
oriental scenery, and over the bar is the orchestra.&nbsp; But
the place is not so crowded as we might expect, and the visitors
are quieter than in the casinos of the West; the men and women
are most of them much younger,&mdash;the men, many of them, have
an exceedingly juvenile appearance, and think it fine to dance
with young ladies of uncertain occupations, and to drink
brandy-and-water and smoke cigars; but they have yet to cut their
wisdom-teeth.&nbsp; As Thackeray says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pretty page with the dimpled chin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That never has known the barber&rsquo;s shear,<br />
All your wish is woman to win;<br />
This is the way that boys begin,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait till you come to forty year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come here in the summer-time, and the attendance is then
numerous; and of a Sunday evening, on the lawn before the Barn,
or in the bowers and alcoves by its side, what vows have been
uttered only to be broken; and what snares have been set for
youth, and beauty, and innocence; and how many have come here
with gay <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>hearts who have left with them
bruised beyond the power of man to heal!&nbsp; Even in this room
itself, what changes have been wrought by the magic hand of
time!&nbsp; Where are the Finsbury radicals&mdash;all beery and
Chartist, who here dined; the demagogues who duped them, the
hopes they cherished, the promises they made?&nbsp; One after
another have the bubbles burst, have the leaders palpably become
shams, have the people woke up to disappointment and despair; and
yet the nation has yet to learn that it is only by individual
righteousness its salvation can be wrought.&nbsp; The dancing,
instead of speech-making, is a sign of the times.&nbsp;
Accompanied as it is by less drinking, let us hope it is a
favourable sign.&nbsp; Let us judge in the spirit of charity and
hope.&nbsp; But let us not be too sanguine,&mdash;it was during
the terrors of the French Directory, when the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Streets ran so red with the blood of the
dead,<br />
That they blush&rsquo;d like the waves of hell,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that Paris became a city of dancers, and that the art reached
a climax unknown before or since.</p>
<h2><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>BOXING NIGHT.</h2>
<p>I am rather out of conceit with Christmas boxes.&nbsp; I have
been wished the compliments of the season by no less than six
individuals this very morning, and for those good wishes I, poor
man though I be, with family of my own to work for, have had to
pay half-a-crown each.&nbsp; I grow suspicious of every smiling
face I meet.&nbsp; I walk with my hands in my pocket, and my eyes
cast down.&nbsp; I wonder how it fares with my strong-minded wife
at home.&nbsp; I know she will have had a rare battle to
fight.&nbsp; She will have had the Postman&mdash;and the
Dustman&mdash;and the Waits&mdash;and the Sweep&mdash;and the
Turncock&mdash;and the Lamplighter&mdash;and the Grocer&rsquo;s
lad&mdash;and the Butcher&rsquo;s boy; and if she compounds with
them at the rate of a shilling a-piece, she may bless her
stars.&nbsp; I feel that I cannot stand much of this kind of
work, and that for a merry Christmas and a happy New Year I shall
have to pay rather handsomely.&nbsp; Stop at home&mdash;tie up
your <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>knockers&mdash;say you are sick or
dead, or a shareholder in the Royal British Bank, still you
cannot escape the tender mercies of a London Boxing day.&nbsp;
Mind, I have not one word to say of the various good wishes and
gifts offered by friends and relatives to each other as pledges
of esteem and goodwill.&nbsp; I would be the last to find fault
with the customs originating in the warm heart of love, and
honoured by the sanction of the whole civilized world.&nbsp; By
all means let us reverence them ten-fold.&nbsp; But I have a
right to complain that I am compelled to pay for mercenary
goodwill, and that on me, or such as me, a tax is levied which
does no good in most cases, and frequently does an immense amount
of harm.&nbsp; When I read, as I am sure to do, in the police
reports of the next day, that, &ldquo;yesterday, being the day
after Boxing day, the time of the magistrates was chiefly
occupied with cases of drunkenness,&rdquo; am I not right in
wishing that I had kept the money in my own pocket?&nbsp; Some of
my friends would do that, but then for the next twelve months
they are hampered and inconvenienced in a thousand ways.&nbsp; As
a wise man, I choose the least of two evils, but I am an
unwilling victim nevertheless.&nbsp; But <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>a truce to
my meditations; let us look at London on a Boxing night.&nbsp; By
daylight you would scarce know London.&nbsp; A new race seems to
have invaded the streets, filled the omnibuses, swarmed in the
bazaars and the Arcade, choked up the eating-houses and the
beer-shops.&nbsp; Smith with his Balmoral boots, Brown with his
all-round collar, Jones with his Noah&rsquo;s Ark coat, Robinson
with the straight tile, which young England deems the cheese,
delight us no more with their snobby appearance and gentish airs;
to-day this is the poor man&rsquo;s holiday.&nbsp; You can tell
him by the awkwardness with which he wears his Sunday clothes, by
the startling colour of his ties, by the audacious appearance of
his waistcoat.&nbsp; If he would only dress as a gentleman
dresses, he would look as well, but he must be fine.&nbsp; Well,
it matters little so long as he be happy, whether he is so or
not; and let him pass with his wife and children, all full of
wonder and delight as they stare in at the shop windows and think
everything&mdash;how happy are they in the delusion!&mdash;that
all that glitter is gold.&nbsp; Let us wish them a merry
Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>
<p>And now the dull, dark day, by the magic power of gas, has
been transformed into gay and <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>brilliant
night.&nbsp; The thousands who have spent the day sight-seeing
are not satiated, and are flocking round the entrances of the
various theatres.&nbsp; Let us stand on the stage of the
Victoria, and see them to the number of fifteen hundred mounted
upon the gallery benches.&nbsp; Through the small door near the
ceiling they come down like a Niagara, and you expect to see them
hurled by hundreds into the pit.&nbsp; What a Babel of
sounds!&nbsp; It is in vain one cries &ldquo;Horder!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ats off!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Down in
front!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;&nbsp; Boys in the
gallery are throwing orange peel all over the pit; Smith halloos
to Brown, and Brown to Smith; a sailor in a private box
recognises some comrades beneath, and immediately a conversation
ensues; rivals meet and quarrel; women treat each other to the
contents of their baskets&mdash;full of undigestible articles,
you may be sure, with a bottle of gin in the corner.&nbsp; The
play&mdash;it is that refreshing drama, the &ldquo;Battersea
Brigand&rdquo;&mdash;proceeds in dumb-show; but the pantomime,
the subject of which is, &ldquo;Wine, War, and Love, and Queen
Virtue in the Vistas of Light or Glitter,&rdquo;&mdash;with what
a breathless calm, that is ushered in.&nbsp; It is an old silly
affair.&nbsp; Harlequin, clown, and <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>pantaloon,
are they not all very dreary in their mirth?&nbsp; Yet the
audience is in a roar of laughter, and little babes clap their
tiny hands, and tears of laughter chase each other down the
withered cheeks of age.&nbsp; This night in every theatre of
London is a similar scene witnessed.&nbsp; The British public is
supposed to be unusually weak at Christmas, and tricks that were
childish and stale when George the Third was king, and jokes
venerable even in Joe Miller&rsquo;s time, are still supposed to
afford the most uproarious amusement to a people boasting its
Christianity, its civilisation, and enlightenment.&nbsp; Of all
conventionalisms those of the stage are the most rigid,
antiquated, and absurd.</p>
<p>But the thousands outside who did not get in&mdash;what are
they about?&nbsp; Look at that respectable mechanic; you saw him
in the morning as happy as a prince, and almost as fine; he
stands leaning against the lamp-post, apparently an idiot.&nbsp;
His hat is broken&mdash;his coat is torn&mdash;his face is
bloody&mdash;his pockets are empty; not a friend is near, and he
is far away from home.&nbsp; It is clear too what he has been
about.&nbsp; Come on a few steps further&mdash;three policemen
are carrying a woman to Bow-street.&nbsp; A hooting <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>crowd follow; she heeds them not, nor cares she that
she has lost her bonnet&mdash;that her hair streams loosely in
the wind&mdash;that her gown (it is her Sunday one) is all torn
to tatters&mdash;or that her person is rudely exposed.&nbsp; The
further we go, and the later it grows, the more of these sad
pictures shall we see.&nbsp; Of course we do not look for such in
Regent-street, or Belgravia, or Oxford-street, or the
Strand.&nbsp; Probably in them we shall meet respectable people
staggering along under the influence of drink&mdash;but they are
not noisy or obstreperous&mdash;they do not curse and
swear&mdash;they do not require the aid of the police.&nbsp; We
must go into the low neighbourhoods&mdash;into St Giles&rsquo;,
or Drury-lane, or Ratcliffe-highway, or the New-cut, or
Whitechapel&mdash;if we would see the miseries of London on
Boxing night.&nbsp; We must take our stand by some
gin-palace.&nbsp; We must stay there till the crowds it has
absorbed and poisoned are turned loose and maddened into the
streets.&nbsp; Then what horrible scenes are realized.&nbsp; Here
an Irish faction meet, and men, women, and children engage in a
general <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, and cries of murder rend the
air, and piercing shrieks vex the dull ear of night.&nbsp; There
two mates are stripped and <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>fighting,
who but this morning were bosom friends, and who to-morrow would
not harm a hair of each other&rsquo;s heads.&nbsp; Here a
mechanic with a bloody head is being borne to the neighbouring
hospital, to lie there a few months at the public expense, while
his family are maintained by the parish.&nbsp; Again, we meet two
wives nursing young babes scared into unnatural silence,
clenching their fists in each other&rsquo;s faces, and with
difficulty restrained from acts of more savage violence by their
drunken husbands.&nbsp; Their day&rsquo;s holiday has come to
this.&nbsp; In the metropolis in 1853, the number of
public-houses was 5729&mdash;the number of beer-shops 3613.&nbsp;
These figures give a total of 9342.&nbsp; If on this night we
suppose on an average one fight in the course of the evening
takes place in each of these drinking shops, we can get some idea
of what goes on in London on a Boxing night.&nbsp; In passing at
midnight down Drury-lane, I see three fights in a five
minutes&rsquo; walk.&nbsp; Enlightened native of Timbuctoo, will
you not pity our London heathens and send a few missionaries
here!</p>
<h2><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>THE MOGUL,</h2>
<p>Not the Great Mogul in Thibet, but the Mogul in Drury-lane, is
an increasingly popular place of public amusement.&nbsp; I was
there a few years since, and it was not more than half
full.&nbsp; The other night I could hardly get standing room,
though I paid sixpence and went with the operative swells into
the gallery.&nbsp; In these days the test of everything is
success.&nbsp; We speak well of the tradesman who does the
largest business&mdash;of the writer whose books sell the
most&mdash;of the actor or preacher that draws the largest
crowd.&nbsp; We do not stop to criticise the manner in which that
business is done, the influence of the writer, the doctrine
taught by the preacher, or the character of the acting.&nbsp; On
the ordinary principle, then, the Mogul is a creditable
establishment, for it is a successful one.&nbsp; Indeed, in the
present state of society, it is hardly possible to conceive how a
place that combines entertainment and drinking together can well
be <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>otherwise.&nbsp; In the course of last summer Vauxhall
was open a few nights; I was credibly informed that on each night
it was supposed not more than half the company paid for
admission, the other half having been admitted by means of
orders.&nbsp; It is calculated the sale of drink and refreshment
to the crowd thus collected will yield a profit sufficient to
cover all expenses.&nbsp; Thus it is such places as the Mogul
pay.&nbsp; The entrance fee and the sale of intoxicating drinks
must amount to a sum out of which a proprietor can extract a
handsome profit.</p>
<p>Thus at the Mogul you have a double attraction.&nbsp; Are you
a gin-drinker, you can go and get your quartern or half-quartern
over the bar&mdash;or you can lounge into the concert-room and
quietly sit soaking the whole evening; for, as the performance
does not close till midnight, the time admits of a man getting
&ldquo;fou&rdquo; between the commencement and the close of the
entertainment.&nbsp; Drury-lane is what may be called a low
neighbourhood, devoted principally to butchers&rsquo; and
bakers&rsquo; shops, pawnbrokers&rsquo; establishments, and
gin-palaces.&nbsp; Pass these latter any hour of the day you
will, and you will find <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>them
crowded by laundresses, and charwomen, and haggard old crones
from the sister isle, and young wives whose husbands, it may be,
are hard at work.&nbsp; There they stand in the streets, with
babies in their arms and dirty children in rags by their side,
gossiping with women as ill-conditioned as themselves; and as
gossiping makes them thirsty, and as drinking makes people drunk,
it is not difficult to imagine the state in which many of these
women are.&nbsp; In the middle of the day it is very obvious that
many of them have had more than enough.&nbsp; How they can afford
it always puzzles me&mdash;I cannot, I know, and I believe my
weekly earnings equal theirs.&nbsp; The pawnbrokers may help
them&mdash;but their material guarantees cannot be perpetually
forthcoming.&nbsp; These gin-drinkers live cheap, I grant.&nbsp;
They herd in the horrid slums of Drury-lane&mdash;and people say
sometimes, Can you wonder that such poor wretches drink? but they
forget that it is the drink that makes them such poor
wretches.&nbsp; The money these women spend in drink would pay
for decent apartments and clothes that would be clean and
comfortable, not ragged and filthy, and stinking with every
abomination.&nbsp; It is not poverty that creates <!-- page
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>drunkenness, but drunkenness that creates poverty, and
the poverty thus created&mdash;the dreariest kind of all
poverty&mdash;abounds in Drury-lane.&nbsp; Well, then, exclaims
one of the new school, who believes mankind are to be regenerated
by fiddling, does not such a place as the Mogul have a beneficial
influence?&nbsp; I will answer this by describing the kind of
amusement afforded at the Mogul.&nbsp; You are pent up in a room
where the air is ten times worse than in any theatre&mdash;any
crowded chapel&mdash;or worse than in the late Reading Room of
the British Museum or the House of Commons.&nbsp; You see a
little of the worst acting in London&mdash;broad farce, chiefly
by artists, if I may term them such, who are more remarkable for
their weakness than their strength.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak the
speech, I pray you, as I pronounce it to you, trippingly on the
tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as
lief the town crier spoke my lines.&nbsp; Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hands,&rdquo; says Hamlet; but actors of the
class you meet in the Mogul never seem to have heard of the
Prince of Denmark.&nbsp; There are some people who doubt whether
good acting has a beneficial effect, but there are none who doubt
that the effect of bad <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>acting is
altogether bad.&nbsp; But the dramatical part of the
entertainment constitutes but a small part of the evening&rsquo;s
amusement.&nbsp; There is a lady who sings sentimental songs, and
a gentleman who sings comic ones, and another gent, with dismal
voice and weary mien, who declares&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>gurls</i> of dear Old England<br />
Are the <i>gurls</i> of <i>gurls</i> for me-e-eh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not aware that any of these performers sing songs of an
objectionable character; and if a sneer is now and then
introduced at what common decent people believe to be good, and
true, and righteous, and of beneficial tendency, it is only,
perhaps, such as would be approved of by the patrons of the
Haymarket.&nbsp; You tell me that this is better than sitting all
night at a bar drinking; but, I ask, is not this entertainment
itself an excuse for drinking?&nbsp; You see the room is full of
men and women evidently belonging to the working classes; now of
all men working men can least afford to waste time in such
places.&nbsp; All their future emphatically depends upon
themselves.&nbsp; More than most men are they called upon to
exercise self-denial and to cultivate their powers, if they would
achieve independence.&nbsp; <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>But how can
the working men who sit night after night in such places as the
Mogul ever hope to rise? yet any night there must be a couple of
hundred of such present, for they swarm like bees.&nbsp; They
come professedly for the entertainment, but all the while it
lasts they are doing a good deal in the drinking line.&nbsp; It
is not one glass or two that will satisfy them; and the worst of
it is, that many very clever fellows when once they begin
drinking do not know when to leave off.&nbsp; In this respect
they are like Dr Johnson, who could either feast or fast, but
could never be a moderate drinker.&nbsp; They come to the
Mogul&mdash;perhaps they would never think of sitting all night
in a public-house&mdash;but they come to the Mogul for the
entertainment, and they finish by drinking as if they had come
for the drink alone.&nbsp; The Mogul is indeed an educational
establishment, but unfortunately it educes the wrong set of
faculties.&nbsp; In Drury-lane, of all lanes in the world, there
is the least occasion to associate intoxicating drink with
happiness.&nbsp; Everywhere the idea is a mischievous delusion
and a remnant of barbarism, but there it is a positive
curse.&nbsp; At the Mogul you will see the sweetheart with her
lover, the mother with <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>her
child,&mdash;it may be the sucking babe,&mdash;till midnight,
breathing an air of tobacco smoke, the husband and the wife, all
you say enjoying themselves in a social way, but all, I say,
encouraging an appetite which, if it gets the mastery,&mdash;and
in the majority of cases it does,&mdash;will destroy them without
mercy.&nbsp; Were the Mogul simply a gin-palace, it would have
far less patronage, it would merely have its share of the general
trade; but the fact that it provides musical and dramatic
entertainments&mdash;that it gives decent people an excuse for
drinking&mdash;that it attracts those whom a common gin-shop
would repel&mdash;is that precisely which gives it its power for
danger.&nbsp; Such places are decoy shops, the more dangerous as
drinking in Drury-lane is really disgusting, and enough to make a
man a teetotaller for life.&nbsp; The neighbourhood is rich in
warnings, but the <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the Mogul soon learns
to heed them not.</p>

<p>A stranger, ignorant of our inner life, and unacquainted with
our social system, knowing only that we call ourselves a
Christian people, and that we boast that Christianity places
woman in a peculiarly favoured position, might dwell among us for
awhile, and, seeing how woman is flattered and followed, might
imagine that our condition was perfect, and that here, at least,
woman, the weak, was sheltered by man, the strong.&nbsp; In the
dazzling ball-room&mdash;on the glittering promenade&mdash;he
might meet the lovely and the fair, and deem that they were no
brilliant exception, but as they were sheltered and loved, so
were sheltered and loved all of their common sex.&nbsp; Grieved
would he be to find out his mistake; yet more grieved would he be
to know that the graceful drapery that added to the beauty that
everywhere flashed upon his eye was wrought by tender and
delicate women, who, pale and wan, slave at the needle from <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>morn till eve, and from eve till again the dim grey of
morn gleamed in the east&mdash;by women withered before their
prime&mdash;by women who, for no crime, but from their simple
desire to live by the honest and honourable labour of their
hands, are shut up in heated and unhealthy rooms, debarred from
social duties and joys, and who know nothing of life but its
wants and woes&mdash;by women who can find in slavery itself
nothing more forlorn than their melancholy fate&mdash;by women to
the majority of whom there is no honest way of escape from the
lingering death that besets them, but the grave.</p>
<p>We would guard our readers against giving way to mawkish
sentimentalism; <i>that</i> it is not our aim to excite.&nbsp;
There are employers who are all they should be; there are
milliners&rsquo; and dressmakers&rsquo; assistants who find their
labour what all healthy labour is, a blessing, and not a
curse.&nbsp; Nor is every dressmaker shut up in these hot-houses
of disease beautiful, nor the daughter of one who has seen better
days.&nbsp; It is true that some of these unfortunate girls are
the daughters of &ldquo;clergymen, medical men, and
officers;&rdquo; but it is because they partake of our common
humanity&mdash;because they have human <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>blood and
human hearts&mdash;because life was given them that in it they
might bless and be blessed&mdash;because, in their injuries and
wrong, the human family and its Father above are injured and
wronged&mdash;that we claim for them from society sympathy and
redress.&nbsp; We say nothing of the moral danger to which, in a
metropolis like this, they are peculiarly exposed.&nbsp; When sin
offers so golden a bait, it shows that those who yet continue at
their work deserve respect and aid.&nbsp; If some of them have
fallen&mdash;if some of them, driven by despair, have walked our
streets to gain their bread, let us blame the system which has
made so infamous and wretched a mode of life seem a change to be
desired.&nbsp; Let the cure be adopted; let the work now done be
distributed among a larger number of hands; and in this country,
at least, there is no lack of persons eager to be employed.&nbsp;
In many of the fashionable establishments increased cost of
production can be of but little moment.&nbsp; Let employers learn
to practise humanity, and let our high-born and influential
ladies see to it, that it is no thoughtlessness of theirs that
compels their poorer sisters to toil with a sinking frame and a
heavy heart.&nbsp; As a nation, we have worked out <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>one problem in civilization; we have shown that the
utmost wealth can exist side by side with the deepest
poverty&mdash;the grossest ignorance with the most cultivated
knowledge&mdash;the most elevating piety with the most debasing
fetichism&mdash;the fairest virtue with the most revolting
vice.&nbsp; Be it our nobler work to show to the nations of the
earth how, while our higher classes live in refinement and
wealth, there is no class, however humble, but can joy in the
possession of social happiness and rights.</p>
<p>But what, you ask, has this to do with Caldwell&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
Only this, that of the class to which I have referred, I believe
more may be found of an evening at Caldwell&rsquo;s, than
anywhere else in London.&nbsp; It is not all dressmakers who toil
thus severely and unnaturally; and few of them are there who do
not in the course of the year find time to pay Caldwell&rsquo;s a
visit.&nbsp; Who has not heard of Caldwell&rsquo;s
<i>Soir&eacute;es Dansantes</i>?&nbsp; Are they not advertised in
every paper?&nbsp; Are they not posted in gigantic bills in every
street?&nbsp; In quiet country lanes, miles and miles away from
town, do we not come across the coloured letters by which Mr
Caldwell announces his entertainment to the world?&nbsp; Who is
Mr John Caldwell?&nbsp; <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>We will let
him speak for himself.&nbsp; He has an establishment in
Dean-street, Soho.&nbsp; The building cost him nearly four
thousand pounds.&nbsp; On boxing-night he had as many as 600
customers, &ldquo;and on average nights,&rdquo; he tells us,
&ldquo;I have about 200.&rdquo;&nbsp; The charge for admission is
eight-pence.&nbsp; Mr Caldwell has a public-house just by, and
from that supplies wine, and ale, and spirits.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have never had a case of drunkenness in my place for years; I am
very particular&mdash;I never let a drunken man
remain.&rdquo;&nbsp; On an average about thirty glasses of
spirits are drunk in the dancing room in the course of an
evening, and about forty glasses of beer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe
my place is carried on in as respectable a manner as can
be.&nbsp; Some of the first noblemen come; there are some very
respectable tradesmen round the neighbourhood, and a great many
young people from the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The rooms are
principally supported by the working classes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
dancing saloon opens at eight, and is closed at a quarter to
twelve.&nbsp; Such is the evidence given by Mr Caldwell himself
before the select committee of the House of Commons on
public-houses.&nbsp; As is perfectly natural, it is all <i>coleur
de rose</i>.&nbsp; The union of the first noblemen <!-- page
185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>and the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the working classes over
spirits-and-water, or in the mazy dance, is a beautiful specimen
of fraternisation, and the small quantity of beer and spirits
drunk by 200 persons indicates an amount of sobriety rare in
places of public amusement.&nbsp; I think Mr Caldwell has a
little understated the case.&nbsp; I fear he forgot to tell the
committee that the drinking at his place was in the
refreshment-room down-stairs, not in the dancing-room above;
while in the latter the small quantity he asserts is consumed, I
am inclined to think, much more may be disposed of
down-stairs.&nbsp; In the course of his own examination some
disagreeable truths oozed out.&nbsp; We give a couple of
questions and answers in proof of this.&mdash;Sir George Grey:
&ldquo;Do you mean to say that the dancing-saloon would have no
sufficient attraction for the people unless there were connected
with it the facility of obtaining spirituous
liquors?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I think not</i>; <i>the people
want a glass of wine</i>, <i>or negus</i>, <i>or
brandy-and-water</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Again, Mr Caldwell has been
unable to procure a license on account of the opposition of the
publicans in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The Chairman asks,
&ldquo;Do you think the publicans would withdraw their
opposition?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Yes</i>, <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span><i>they
begin to find my house an advantage</i>; <i>when parties leave my
rooms</i>, <i>they stand together at the corner of the
streets</i>, <i>and say</i>, <i>We will have a parting
glass</i>.&nbsp; <i>They do not all have it at my
rooms</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this answer does not well coincide with Mr
Caldwell&rsquo;s former evidence.&nbsp; It is quite as much the
drink as the dancing that is the attraction, and as to his
respectable tradesmen, and the fact of persons not being tipsy,
and that of some of the first noblemen coming there, all these
assertions are fairly open to criticism.&nbsp; It was only the
other day I heard a London magistrate declare that publicans
never could tell when a person was tipsy; and as to
respectability, your Robsons, and Camerons, and Sadleirs are
always considered highly respectable.&nbsp; Ask the first person
you meet about your neighbours.&nbsp; What is the answer?&nbsp;
Oh, they are a highly respectable family; they are immensely
rich.&nbsp; And as to noblemen coming into such places, I imagine
that would be precisely the reason why the judicious father of a
pretty girl would prefer her dancing anywhere rather than in Mr
Caldwell&rsquo;s establishment in Dean-street.&nbsp; I have not
much faith in the benefits of that species <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>of the
mixture of all ranks.&nbsp; Like the Irishman&rsquo;s
reciprocity, it is all on one side.&nbsp; Tennyson makes his hero
tell Lady Clara Vere de Vere&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At me you smiled, but unbeguiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the snare and I retired,&mdash;<br />
The daughter of a hundred earls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not one to be desired.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But perchance a young maiden, led away by the excitement of
the hour, could not find it in her heart to address similar
language to Lady Clara Vere de Vere&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; The
last victim always believes that she is to be the exception to
all general rules; she may transgress, but not pay the
penalty&mdash;pluck the forbidden fruit, and for doing so not
forfeit Eden&mdash;plunge wildly into sin, and sorrow, and shame,
and yet find peace in her heart and the light of heaven lying on
her path; but cause and effect are eternal, and, youth gone, and
pleasure gone, and the power to attract gone, and the inward
sense of right succeeded by the stings of conscience and the
gnawing of remorse, what is left but to weep madly and in vain
for</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tender grace of a day that is
dead&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>But we are in Caldwell&rsquo;s,&mdash;let us go into
the gallery and look down.&nbsp; I know not the name of the new
dances, but how the women swim round the room, as the music now
hurriedly hastens, now softly dies away.&nbsp; The girl that
dances here so modestly to-night in twelve months will have lost
her maiden shame, will be dressed in silks and satins, will be
dancing at the Argyll, and supping at Scott&rsquo;s or
Quin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That girl they call Rose&mdash;and a rose she
is, for she might shine in a Belgravian drawing-room, and walks
in beauty as a fairy queen&mdash;might have lit up a home with
her love, and made a brave heart proud; but here she comes, night
after night, and domestic life is to her tame after music and
dancing such as she has here.&nbsp; Beauty you will not find much
of, nor that overdress which stamps the character of the women at
the Casino or the Argyll in unmistakeable terms; and the men are
the class you usually meet in these places.&nbsp; They may be
pickpockets, or they may be peers; you can scared tell the
difference in these levelling days.&nbsp; If I had not Mr
Caldwell&rsquo;s express assertion to the contrary, I should
certainly say that that young fellow with a pint bottle of
champagne in his hand was decidedly drunk,&mdash;at any rate,
<!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>he has very much the appearance of a tipsy person; but
the waiters seem to be of Mr Caldwell&rsquo;s opinion, and are
still offering him more drink, and the women around seem to think
it is rather fun than otherwise.&nbsp; Ah! little do they reflect
how such as he, under the influences of drink, forget the
decencies of life, the claims of duty, forget even the common
instincts of common humanity; so that the wife, whom he has vowed
to love, honour, and protect, is abandoned, and the home
forsaken, for the orgies of the public-house.&nbsp; Do the women
around us ever expect to be the wives and mothers of such, or
have they, young and fair as many of them seem, learnt already
that recklessness as to the future which robs life of all its
glory, and incarcerates the soul in a living grave?&nbsp; I can
see, even here, a gaiety more sad than tears.&nbsp; But I need
not continue my description; dancing in public rooms in the
metropolis is much the same everywhere.&nbsp; Of course the place
is all that Mr Caldwell says it is.&nbsp; I believe with him that
it is as respectably conducted as establishments of the kind can
be; but at the same time Mr Caldwell confesses it leads to
drinking, and that is quite <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>reason
enough, independently of other obvious considerations, why I come
away thankful that no wife or sister of mine is amongst the
parties nightly to be met at Mr Caldwell&rsquo;s
<i>soir&eacute;es dansantes</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In<span class="smcap"> </span>a set of pictures
illustrative of Greek customs, it was quite impossible to leave
out the <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> who gave such a peculiar
colouring to Grecian levity, and exercised so potent a sway over
the life of the younger members of the community.&nbsp; Abundant
materials for such a sketch exist, for the Greeks made no secret
of matters of this kind; the difficulty has been not to sacrifice
the vividness of the picture of the ordinary intercourse with
these women to the demands of our modern sense of
propriety,&rdquo; says Professor Becker, in his truly admirable
work on the Private Life of the Ancient Greeks.&nbsp; In the same
manner, and for the same reason, the modern sense of propriety is
supposed to be in the way of any very graphic description of
Cremorne; yet we have het&aelig;r&aelig; almost as bewitching as
Aspasia or the Corinthian Lais; and if our students, and learned

not speak of ours which last all the summer, and the scene of

And, reeling, own the mighty wine-god&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is in Cremorne.&nbsp; If Corinth had her groves sacred
to Aphrodite, so has Cremorne.&nbsp; It offends our modern sense
of propriety to speak of such matters.&nbsp; English people only
see what they wish to see.&nbsp; If you are true&mdash;if you
look at real life and say what you think of it, you shock our
modern sense of propriety.&nbsp; We may talk about drainage and
ventilation, and the advantages of soap, but there we must
stop.&nbsp; Keep the outside clean, but don&rsquo;t look
within.&nbsp; Thus is it our writers make such blunders.&nbsp;
For instance, good-meaning Mrs Stowe, after she had written Uncle
Tom, came here to be lionized, and to write a book about
us.&nbsp; She did so, and a very poor book it was.&nbsp; But I
must quote one passage <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>from
&ldquo;Sunny Memories.&rdquo;&nbsp; In writing of a visit she
paid to the Jardin Mobile in Paris, she writes, &ldquo;Entrance
to this Paradise can be had, for gentlemen a dollar, ladies
<i>free</i>; this tells the whole story.&nbsp; Nevertheless, do
not infer that there are not respectable ladies there; it is a
place so remarkable that very few strangers stay long in Paris
without taking a look at it.&nbsp; And though young ladies
residing in Paris never go, and matrons very seldom, yet
occasionally it is the case that some ladies of respectability
look in.&nbsp; Nevertheless, aside from the impropriety inherent
in the very nature of the waltzing, there was not a word, look,
or gesture of immorality or impropriety.&nbsp; The dresses were
all decent, and, if there was vice, it was vice masked under the
guise of polite propriety.&nbsp; How different, I could not but
reflect, is all this from the gin-palaces of London!&nbsp; There,
there is indeed a dazzling splendour of gas-lights, but there is
nothing artistic, nothing refined, nothing appealing to the
imagination.&nbsp; There are only hogsheads and barrels, and the
appliances for serving out strong drink; and there for one sole
end&mdash;the swallowing of the fiery stimulant&mdash;come the
nightly thousands, from the gay and <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>well-dressed to the haggard and tattered, in the last
stage of debasement.&nbsp; The end is the same, by how different
paths!&nbsp; Here they dance along the path to ruin with flowers
and music&mdash;there they cast themselves bodily, as it were,
into the lake of fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; A more unfair comparison, I
think, was never drawn; a drinking-shop is much the same
everywhere, and in Paris as well as in London, people, to use Mrs
Stowe&rsquo;s own words, cast themselves bodily into the lake of
fire.&nbsp; We have our Jardin Mobile, but of course Mrs Stowe
never went there&mdash;as we have known good people confessing to
entering theatres in Germany or France who on no account would
have gone near one at home.&nbsp; If Mrs Stowe had confessed to
going to Cremorne, she would have been cut, and so she went to
the Paris Cremorne instead; but to write a true book on England,
she should have gone to Cremorne.&nbsp; Look at Cremorne; is it
not one, as Disraeli is reported to have said, of the
institutions of the country? <a name="citation194"></a><a
href="#footnote194" class="citation">[194]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page
195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>The gardens are beautiful, are kept in fine order, are
adorned with really fine trees, and are watered by the Thames,
here almost a silver stream.&nbsp; Though near London, on a
summer evening the air is fresh and balmy, the amusements are
varied, the company are genteel in appearance, and here, as in
Paris, they dance along the path to ruin with flowers and
music.&nbsp; If Mrs Stowe gives the preference to the Parisians,
she may be right, but I am inclined to dispute the grounds of
that preference.&nbsp; The gin-palaces are filled with our sots,
with our utter wrecks, with all that is loathsome and low in man
or woman.&nbsp; Your son, fresh from home and its sacred
influences, is shy of entering a gin-palace at first.&nbsp; He
goes there with a blush upon his cheek, and a sense of shame at
his heart.&nbsp; He shrinks from its foul companionship, and when
he has come out he resolves never to be what he has seen under
those accursed roofs.&nbsp; But you take him to Cremorne, or you
send him to the Lowther Arcade, or the Holborn Casino, and he is
surrounded by temptation that speaks to him with almost
irresistible power.&nbsp; The women are well-dressed and
well-behaved.&nbsp; The drink does not repel but merely
stimulates the <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>hot passions of youth, and lulls the
conscience.&nbsp; For one man that is ruined in a gin-shop there
are twenty that are ruined at Cremorne.</p>
<p>As to the morality of such places, that is not to be settled
dogmatically by me or by any one else.&nbsp; Tennyson talks of
men fighting their doubts, and gathering strength; in the same
manner, men may fight temptation and gather strength, and one man
may merely spend a pleasant evening where another may in the same
interval of time ruin himself for life.&nbsp; The tares and the
wheat, in this confused world of ours, grow side by side.&nbsp;
Unnaturally, we bring up our sons only to pluck what we deem the
wheat; and immediately they are left to themselves, they begin
gathering the tares, which we have not taught them are such, and
have for them at least the charm of novelty.&nbsp; It does not do
to say there is no pleasure in the world; there is a great
deal.&nbsp; The grass is green, though, it may be, sad sinners
tread it.&nbsp; The sun shines as sweetly on carrion as on the
Koh-i-noor.&nbsp; The lark high up at heaven&rsquo;s gate sings
as loud a song of praise, whether villains or lovers listen to
its lays.&nbsp; Places are what we make them.&nbsp; I fear there
are many blackguards at Cremorne; <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the women
most of them are undoubtedly het&aelig;r&aelig;, and yet what a
place it is for fun!&nbsp; How jolly are all you meet!&nbsp; How
innocent are all the amusements,&mdash;the ascent of the
balloon&mdash;the dancing&mdash;the equestrian
performances&mdash;the comic song&mdash;the
illuminations&mdash;the fire-works&mdash;the promenade on the
grass lawn or in the gas-lit paths; the impulses that come to us
in the warm breath of the summer eve, how grateful are they all,
and what a change from Cheap-side or from noisy manufactories
still more confined!&nbsp; By this light the scene is almost a
fairy one.&nbsp; Can there be danger here?&nbsp; Is there here
nothing artistic&mdash;nothing refined&mdash;nothing appealing to
the imagination?&nbsp; Come here, Mrs Stowe, and judge.&nbsp; You
will scandalize, I know, that portion of the religious public
that never yet has looked at man and society honestly in the
face, but you will better understand the frightful hypocrisies of
our domestic life; you will better understand how it is that a
religion which we pay so much for, and to which we render so much
outward homage, has so little hold upon the heart and life.&nbsp;
There is no harm in Cremorne, if man is born merely to enjoy
himself&mdash;to eat, drink, be merry, and die.&nbsp; I grant, it
<!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>is rather inconvenient for a young man who has his way
to fight in life to indulge a taste for pleasure, to launch out
into expenses beyond his means, to mix with company that is more
amusing than moral, and to keep late hours; and young fellows who
go to Cremorne must run all these risks.&nbsp; It may do you, my
good sir, no harm to go there.&nbsp; You have arrived at an age
when the gaieties of life have ceased to be dangerous.&nbsp; You
come up by one of the Citizen boats to Chelsea after business
hours, and stroll into the garden and view the balloon, or sit
out the ballet, or gaze with a leaden eye upon the riders, and
the clowns, and the dancing, or the fireworks, and return home in
decent time to bed; and if you waste a pound or two, you can
afford it.&nbsp; But it is otherwise with inflammable
youth&mdash;a clerk, it may be, in a merchant&rsquo;s warehouse
on 30<i>s.</i> a-week, and it is really alarming to think what
excitements are thus held out to the passions, at all times so
difficult to control.&nbsp; There are the North Woolwich
Gardens&mdash;there is Highbury Barn&mdash;all rivalling
Cremorne, and all capable of containing some thousands of idle
pleasure-seekers.&nbsp; Vauxhall, with its drunken orgies, is
gone never to return&mdash;the place that <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>knows it
now will know it no more for ever&mdash;but such places are what
thoughtless people call respectable, are frequented by
respectable people; and amidst mirth and music, foaming up in the
sparkling wine, looking out of dark blue eyes, reddening the
freshest cheeks, and nestling in the richest curls, there lurks
the great enemy of God and man.&nbsp; Young man, such an enemy
you cannot resist; your only refuge is in flight.&nbsp; Ah, you
think that face fair as you ask its owner to drink with you; it
would have been fairer had it never gone to Cremorne.&nbsp; A
father loved her as the apple of his eye; she was the sole
daughter of his home and heart, and here she comes night after
night to drink and dance; a few years hence and you shall meet
her drinking and cursing in the lowest gin-palaces of St
Giles&rsquo;s, and the gay fast fellows around you now will be
digging gold in Australia, or it may be walking the streets in
rags, or it may be dying in London hospitals of lingering
disease, or, which is worse than all, it may be living on year
after year with all that is divine in man utterly blotted out and
destroyed.&nbsp; The path that leads to life is strait and
narrow, and few there be who find it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>THE COSTERMONGERS&rsquo;
FREE-AND-EASY.</h2>
<p>Every<span class="smcap"> </span>class in London has its
particular pleasures.&nbsp; The gay have their theatres&mdash;the
philanthropic their Exeter Hall&mdash;the wealthy their
&ldquo;ancient concerts&rdquo;&mdash;the costermongers what they
term their sing-song.</p>
<p>I once penetrated into one of these dens.&nbsp; It was
situated in a very low neighbourhood, not far from a gigantic
brewery, where you could not walk a yard scarcely without coming
to a public house.&nbsp; The costermongers are a numerous
race.&nbsp; Walk the poor neighbourhoods on a Saturday night, and
hear the cries,&mdash;&ldquo;Chestnuts all &rsquo;ot a penny a
score,&rdquo; &ldquo;Three a penny, Yarmouth bloaters,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Penny a lot fine russets, a penny a lot,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your time, fine whelks, a penny a
lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, the itinerant vendors of these delicacies
are costermongers.&nbsp; Or in the daytime see the long carts
drawn by donkies loaded with greens and other vegetables, all
announced to the public in stentorian lungs&mdash;these men are
costermongers.&nbsp; <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Listen to those boys calling,
&ldquo;Ho, ho, hi, hi,&mdash;what do you think of this here? a
penny a bunch, a penny a bunch.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s your
turnips!&rdquo;&nbsp; Those boys are costermongers&rsquo;
lads.&nbsp; It is seldom they last long as men.&nbsp; They soon
lose their voice, and how they pick up a living then no one can
tell.&nbsp; Their talk is peculiar.&nbsp; Mr Mayhew tells us
their slang consists merely in pronouncing each word as if spelt
backwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, Curly, will you do a <i>top</i> of
<i>reeb</i> (pot of beer)?&rdquo; one costermonger may say to
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>on doog</i>, Whelkey, <i>on
doog</i>&rdquo; (no good, no good), the second may reply;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a regular <i>troseno</i> (bad sort) to-day;
I&rsquo;ve been doing <i>dab</i> (bad) with my <i>tol</i>
(lot)&mdash;han&rsquo;t made a <i>yennep</i> (penny), s&rsquo;
elp me&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve cleared a
<i>flatchenorc</i> (half a crown) a&rsquo; ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Master Whelkey will answer perhaps, &ldquo;But <i>kool</i> the
<i>esilop</i> (look at the police), <i>kool him</i> (look at
him).&nbsp; Curly: <i>Nommus</i> (be off), I am going <i>to do
the tightner</i>&rdquo; (have my dinner).&nbsp; Would you know
more of them, come with me.</p>
<p>Just look at the people in this public-house.&nbsp; A more
drunken, dissipated, wretched lot you never saw.&nbsp; There are
one or two little tables in front of the bar and benches, and on
these <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>benches are the most wretched men
and women possible to imagine.&nbsp; They are drinking gin and
smoking, and all have the appearance of confirmed sots.&nbsp;
They are shoemakers in the neighbourhood, and these women with
them are their wives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless you,
sir,&rdquo; exclaims the landlord, &ldquo;they spend all they has
in drink.&nbsp; They live on a penny roll and a ha&rsquo;porth of
sprats or mussels, and they never buy any clothes, except once in
three or four years, and then they get some second-hand
rubbish.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here, when they are not at work, they
sit spending their money.&nbsp; Are there none to save
them?&mdash;none to come here and pluck these brands from the
burning?&nbsp; I know they are short-lived; I see in their pale,
haggard, blotched, and bloated faces premature death.&nbsp; The
first touch of illness will carry them off as rotten leaves fall
in November; but ere this be the case, can you not reveal to them
one glimpse of a truer and diviner life?&nbsp; But come up-stairs
into this concert-room, where about a hundred costermongers and
shoemakers are listening to the charms of song.&nbsp; Talk about
the refining influence of music! it is not here you will find
such to be the case.&nbsp; The men and women and lads sitting
round these shabby <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>looking tables have come here to
drink, for that is their idea of enjoyment; and whilst we would
not grudge them one particle of mirth, we cannot but regret that
their standard of enjoyment should be so low.&nbsp; The landlord
is in the chair, and a professional man presides at the
piano.&nbsp; As to the songs, they are partly professional and
partly by volunteers.&nbsp; I cannot say much for their
character.&nbsp; The costermongers have not very strict notions
of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>; they are not remarkable for
keeping all the commandments; their reverence for the
conventional ideas of decency and propriety is not very profound;
their notions are not peculiarly polished or refined, nor is the
language in which they are clothed, nor the mode in which they
are uttered, such as would be recognised in Belgravia.&nbsp;
Dickens makes Mrs General in &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; remark,
&ldquo;Society never forms opinions, and is never
demonstrative.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, the costermongers are the
reverse of all this, and as the pots of heavy and the quarterns
of juniper are freely quaffed, and the world and its cares are
forgotten, and the company becomes hourly more noisy and
hilarious, you will perceive the truth of my remarks.&nbsp;
Anybody sings who likes; sometimes a <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>man,
sometimes a female, volunteers a performance, and I am sorry to
say it is not the girls who sing the most delicate songs.&nbsp;
The burdens of these songs are what you might expect.&nbsp; In
one you were recommended not to go courting in the kitchen when
the master was at home, but, instead, to choose the
&ldquo;airey.&rdquo;&nbsp; One song, with a chorus, was devoted
to the deeds of &ldquo;those handsome men, the French
Grenadiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another recommended beer as a remedy for
low spirits; and thus the harmony of the evening is continued
till twelve, when the landlord closes his establishment, to the
great grief of the few who have any money left, who would only be
too happy to keep it up all night.&nbsp; Let me say a word about
costermonger literature.&nbsp; I see Mr Manby Smith calculates
its pecuniary value at twelve thousand a year.&nbsp; It is
wretched in every way,&mdash;in composition, in printing, in
cuts, and paper.&nbsp; These street ballads&mdash;we are all
familiar with them&mdash;are sold by a class of men called
patterers, and are written so as to bear on the events of the
day.&nbsp; Thus, at the last Lord Mayor&rsquo;s day we had a song
sung in the streets, of which the following is a
specimen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>&ldquo;Away they go, the high and
low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such glorious sights was never seen,<br />
But still the London Lord Mayor&rsquo;s show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not as it has former been,<br />
When old Dick Whittington was mayor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our forefathers had to go;<br />
They had not got no Peelers there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To guard great London&rsquo;s Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
show.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we are told in another verse that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They will talk of Russia, France, and
that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mention how the money goes;<br />
Each man will eat a pect of sprats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the fashion at the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
show.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of these songs are indecent; almost all of them have a
morbid sympathy with criminals.&nbsp; Thus Redpath in the
following lines is almost made a martyr to his benevolence and
Christian life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I am convicted, there&rsquo;s
no one to blame&mdash;<br />
I suppose you all know Leopold Redpath is my name;<br />
I have one consolation, perhaps I&rsquo;ve more,<br />
All the days of my life <i>I ne&rsquo;er injured the
poor</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I procured for the widow and orphan their bread,<br />
The naked I clothed, and the hungry I fed;<br />
But still I am sentenced, you must understand,<br />
Because I had broken the laws of the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A last fond adieu to my heart-broken wife&mdash;<br />
Leopold Redpath, your husband, &rsquo;s transported for life;<br
/>
Providence will protect you, love, do not deplore,<br />
<i>Since your husband never hurted or injured the poor</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;In London and Weybridge <i>I in splendour did
dwell</i>,<br />
<i>By the rich and the poor was respected right well</i>;<br />
But now I&rsquo;m going&mdash;oh! where shall I say&mdash;<br />
A convict from England, oh! far, far away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have lived happy with my virtuous wife,<br />
Kept away from temptation, from tumult and strife,<br />
I&rsquo;d enough to support me in happiness to live,<br />
<i>But I wanted something more poor people for to
give</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The street singers of the metropolis seized upon the Waterloo
Bridge Tragedy as a fit subject for the exercise of their dismal
strains.&nbsp; The following is printed verbatim, from an
illustrated broadsheet vended &ldquo;at the charge of one
halfpenny:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh such a year for dreadful murders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As this before was never seen;<br />
In England, Ireland, Britain over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such horrid crimes has never been.<br />
But this which now has been discovered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Very far exceeds the whole,<br />
The very thought makes men to shudder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How horrible for to unfold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See and read in every paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This dreadful crime, this mystery,<br />
Worse, far worse, than James Greenacre&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the London mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His body it was cut to pieces&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh how dreadful was his fate!<br />
Then placed in brine and hid in secret&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Horrible for to relate.<br />
The head and limbs had been divided&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where parts was taken no one knows;<br />
In a carpet bag they packed the body,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over Waterloo bridge they did it throw.</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;It is supposed that a female monster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her victim&rsquo;s body onward dragged,<br />
With no companion to assist her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All packed within a carpet bag.<br />
Justice determined is to take her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When without doubt she&rsquo;ll punished be,<br />
The atrocious female Greenacre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Waterloo Bridge Tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader will see from these specimens how alien the
costermonger race is in sympathy and life from the respectable
and the well-to-do.&nbsp; Their songs are not ours, nor their
aims nor conventional observances.&nbsp; What wonder is it that
they leave their wretched cellars all dirt and darkness, and
crowd round the public-house; or that at the costermongers&rsquo;
house of call&mdash;in the midst of an atmosphere of gin and
tobacco-smoke, and under the influence of songs of very
questionable merit&mdash;the poor lads receive the education
which is to stamp their character and to teach them to grow up
Ishmaelites, with their hands against every one, and every
one&rsquo;s hand against them.&nbsp; Society will not educate its
poor; wonder not then that they educate themselves, and that
after a fashion not very desirable in the eyes of the friends of
morality, of order, and of law.</p>
<h2><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>THE POLICE-COURT</h2>
<p>Is an attractive lounge to the seedy, the disreputable, the
unwashed.&nbsp; Evidently it is a grand and refreshing and
popular sight to see justice doled out in small parcels&mdash;to
see the righteous flourish, and the wicked put to shame.&nbsp; I
fear, however, it is a feeling of a more personal nature that is
the chief attraction, after all.&nbsp; Jones goes to see what a
mess Davis gets into; Smithes to see if Scroggins keeps
&ldquo;mum&rdquo; like a brick; the many, to retail a little
scandal at the expense of their neighbours,&mdash;if at the
expense of a friend, of course so much the better.&nbsp; A little
before ten a crowd is ranged round the police-office, waiting to
see the prisoners, who have been locked up all night, marched
into the court, which generally commences its operations at
ten.&nbsp; The court itself offers very little accommodation to
the most thinking public.&nbsp; At one end of the room is the
presiding magistrate; below him is the clerk; on the right of the
magistrate is the <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>box for complainant and
witnesses.&nbsp; Opposite him is the dock in which the defendant
is placed; behind some boards, over which only tall people can
see, is the public; and on the magistrate&rsquo;s right are the
reporters&mdash;or, rather, the penny-a-liners&mdash;who write on
&ldquo;flimsy,&rdquo; and leave &ldquo;copy&rdquo; on spec. at
all the daily paper offices.&nbsp; Let me say a word about these
exceedingly seedy-looking individuals connected with the fourth
estate.&nbsp; That they are not better dressed is, I take it,
their own fault, and arises from that daring defiance of
conventionalism which is so great a characteristic of the lower
orders of gentlemen connected with the press.&nbsp; Let me say,
<i>en passant</i>, the public owe these men much.&nbsp; It is
they who labour with a perseverance worthy of a better cause, and
that deserves to be successful, to describe the cases heard in
the police-courts in the most racy and tempting terms.&nbsp; In
their peculiar phraseology, every bachelor who gets into a scrape
is a gay Lothario, and every young woman that appeals to justice
is lady-like in manners and interesting in appearance.&nbsp; The
poor wretch that crawls along the street, all rouged and decked
out in finery not her own, is &ldquo;a dashing
Cyprian.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Every Irishman is described as
&ldquo;a native of the Green Isle;&rdquo; every man in a red
coat, &ldquo;a brave son of Mars;&rdquo; every sailor, &ldquo;a
jolly tar;&rdquo; and a man with a little hair on his chin, or
under it, is invariably &ldquo;bearded like the pard;&rdquo; and
if anything causing a smile occurs,&mdash;and sometimes on the
gravest occasions justice will even grin,&mdash;the court
is&mdash;so they always put it&mdash;convulsed with
laughter.&nbsp; Knights of the pen, a police-case loving-to-read
public should be grateful to you!&nbsp; By the side of the
reporters often sit some three or four of those mischief-makers,
pettifogging attorneys; men who, in their own opinion, only
require a clear stage and no favour, and the mere formality of a
call to the bar, to rival, if not surpass, the fame of a
Scarlett, or a Brougham, or a Lyndhurst, or an Erskine, or even
of a Coke himself; and truly if to bully, to suppress what is
true, and insinuate what is false&mdash;if to gloss over the
injustice done by a client, and to proclaim aloud that of the
opposite party&mdash;if to speak in an emphatic manner and at a
most unmerciful length&mdash;if to browbeat witnesses, mislead
the court, and astonish the weak nerves of their hearers,
constitute a fitness for legal greatness, these gentlemen <!--
page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>have only to enter their names at any of the Inns of
Court, and eat the requisite number of dinners, to win at once
undying reputation.&nbsp; At the dock appears the trembling
culprit, guarded sedulously by the police, who quietly assume his
or her guilt, and do all they can in endeavouring to make out a
case,&mdash;occasionally going so far in their zeal as to state
things not exactly true, the <i>esprit de corps</i> of course
leading them to aid each other whenever they have a chance.</p>
<p>In a low neighbourhood the principal cases heard are those
arising from intoxication.&nbsp; On this particular morning we
will suppose the court opens with what is very common, an assault
case between two Irish families who were hereditary foes, and
who, emigrating, or rather, like Eneas, &ldquo;driven by
fate,&rdquo; from the mother country at the same time, locate,
unfortunately for themselves, in the same
neighbourhood,&mdash;and who, in accordance with the well-known
remark of Horace, continue in St Giles&rsquo;s the amicable
quarrels of Tipperary, to the amusement of a congenial
neighbourhood, which likes a good fight rather than not, but to
the intense terror and annoyance of all such of her
Majesty&rsquo;s lieges as <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>are well
disposed.&nbsp; As generally happens, the case, after a
considerable amount of hard swearing on both sides, is dismissed,
leaving to each party the inestimable privilege of paying
costs.&nbsp; This case creates great interest; complainants and
defendants are well-known performers, and the mob comes to see
them as people go to see Wright at the Adelphi.&nbsp; When it
terminates, the Guelphs and Ghibelines leave the court to discuss
the oft-told tale in the nearest public-house.&nbsp; The
remaining cases are those of sailors and navvies, charged with
being drunk and disorderly, of robberies committed by prostitutes
when their victims were stupified by beer, and of ragged urchins
with precocious developments, the head and front of whose
offending was that they &ldquo;heaved&rdquo; stones, or that they
declined to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; when particularly requested to
do so by the police.&nbsp; Poor little outcasts, they are better
off in jail than on the streets; and they know it, and own to an
astonishing number of convictions, and gladly look forward to the
time when they shall be able to achieve greater enormities and
manlier offences against law.&nbsp; These cases are soon disposed
of; in the majority the magistrate hears the complaint, and
simply tells <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>the little urchin he &ldquo;may go
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; But let us not leave yet.&nbsp; That is a
publican, and he has a charge against this decent-looking
woman,&mdash;she is not a drunkard;&mdash;let us listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Phil. Bird,&rdquo; says the superintendent.</p>
<p>As Phil. Bird is in court, there is no need to call him, but
he is called in stentorian tones nevertheless.&nbsp; Policemen,
like other men, love to hear the sound of their own voices.&nbsp;
Phil. immediately steps into the witness-box.&nbsp; That he is a
favourite with the beer-drinking public around is clear as soon
as he kisses the Bible, and promises&mdash;a promise lightly
made, and lightly broken&mdash;to speak the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, &ldquo;So help me
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bird,&rdquo; says the magistrate, &ldquo;will you
state your complaint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your honour,&rdquo; is the reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was in my shop on Saturday, when that woman (pointing to
the trembling female in the dock) came in kicking up a row, and
asking for her husband; well, she spoke to her husband, and
wanted to get him away, but her husband did not choose to go; and
as she would not leave quietly, I was obliged to go and speak to
her, <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>upon which she turned round, abusing
me, saying I had robbed her of her husband, that I had got his
money, and kept making a great many remarks which I was not going
to submit to, especially as she had got quite a crowd of people
together, and it was interfering with my business; so I called in
policeman Brown, and gave her in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Policeman Brown corroborates the testimony.&nbsp; He has yet
to win his spurs, and is glad of an opportunity of distinguishing
himself; besides, he has drunk too much of Phil. Bird&rsquo;s
fine sparkling ales to refuse to do him a little friendly turn
when he has a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Bird&rsquo;s house is a well-conducted house, I
believe, Mr Superintendent?&rdquo; says the magistrate, more from
habit than with any view of eliciting information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, your worship,&rdquo; is the
answer,&mdash;&ldquo;impossible to be better.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
superintendent, perhaps, has received a small cask of Devonshire
cyder, as a mark of private friendship and personal esteem, from
the complainant, and this might, though I would fain hope
not&mdash;but flesh is grass, and a superintendent of police is
but flesh after all&mdash;have influenced the nature of <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>his reply.&nbsp; This is the more probable, as one
bystander whispers to another, that he believes Phil.
Bird&rsquo;s is the worst house in the street, a remark which
seems to excite the cordial approbation of the party to whom it
is addressed&mdash;a remark also which the superintendent hears,
and which leads him to cry &ldquo;silence&rdquo; in his loudest
voice and sternest manner.&nbsp; The whisperer is cowed at
once.</p>
<p>Phil. Bird looks gratefully at the superintendent; the latter
is grateful in O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s sense, and has a lively
sense of favours to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the woman, what about her?&rdquo; asks the
magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe generally she&rsquo;s very well
behaved,&rdquo; says policeman Brown, as if on the present
occasion she had been guilty of an enormous offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything against her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know of, yer worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the magistrate, addressing the poor
washerwoman, nervous and &ldquo;all of a tremble,&rdquo; as she
afterwards confidentially informs a friend, looking as if she
expected immediate sentence of death passed upon her, &ldquo;what
do you say to the charge?&nbsp; Mr Bird says you went and <!--
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>created a disturbance in his shop; now you had no
business to do that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I hadn&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; said the poor woman;
but here she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Had she been alone with the magistrate, who is a kind-hearted
man, and wishes to do what is right, she would soon have found
her tongue, and her warm appeal, told with natural eloquence,
because told out of a full heart, would soon have reached his
own; but she is frightened&mdash;her energies are
paralysed,&mdash;she cannot speak at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Brown,&rdquo; says the magistrate, as if a bright
thought struck him, &ldquo;was the woman sober?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t swear that she was drunk,&rdquo;
said Brown, reluctantly.</p>
<p>This by no means helps to soothe the poor woman&rsquo;s
nerves, but it drives her to speak in her own behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship,&rdquo; she exclaims, &ldquo;I was as
sober as you are now&rdquo;&mdash;she might have added, but she
did not, &ldquo;and a good deal more sober than policeman
Brown.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I did go to Phil. Bird&rsquo;s, but it
was to fetch my husband out, who had been inveigled in there, and
had been led <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>into spending all the money he had,
and getting drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my good woman, the publican must be
protected.&nbsp; You should not have created a disturbance.&nbsp;
I shan&rsquo;t inflict a fine, but you must pay the costs.&nbsp;
You may go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the time of the magistrate is taken up; not one case
out of ten comes to anything; but the officiousness of the police
is shown; the lazy and good-for-nothing part of the public have a
gratuitous entertainment provided for them, and the criminal
class get an initiation into the secrets of the law, which robs
it of its terrors, as in such matters it is especially true
familiarity breeds contempt.&nbsp; Most of the lads and
girls&mdash;especially the latter&mdash;placed at the bar, rather
seem to like the excitement, and go before the bench in their
best clothes and with their best looks, as they go to the gallery
of the Victoria or the Sunday tea-garden.</p>
<h2><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>THE EAGLE TAVERN</h2>
<p>Is situated in an appropriate locality in the City-road, not
far from a lunatic asylum, and contiguous to a workhouse.&nbsp;
From time immemorial the Cockneys have hastened thither to enjoy
themselves.&nbsp; Children are taught to say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Up and down the City-road,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In and out the Eagle,<br />
That&rsquo;s the way the money goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pop goes the weasel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the apprentice or clerk, fresh from the country, and
anxious to see life, generally commences with a visit to the
Grecian Saloon&mdash;Eagle Tavern.&nbsp; As a rule, I do not
think what are termed fast men go much to theatres.&nbsp; To sit
out a five-act tragedy and then a farce is a bore which only
quiet old fogies and people of a domestic turn can endure; and
even where, as in the Grecian Saloon, you have dancing, and
singing, and drinking added, it is not the fast men, but the
family parties, that make it pay.&nbsp; <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>There you
see Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson, with their respective
partners and the dear pledges of their well-regulated
loves.&nbsp; They come early, sit out <i>Jack Shepherd</i> with a
resolution worthy of a better cause, listen to the singing from
the Music Hall, return again to witness the closing theatrical
performances, and enjoy all the old stage tricks as if they had
not heard them for the last fifty years.&nbsp; These worthy
creatures see a splendour in the Grecian Saloon which I do
not.&nbsp; Then there are the juvenile swells.&nbsp; Anxious
mothers in the country, fearing the contaminations of London and
the ruin it has brought on other sons, lodge them in remote
Islington, or Hoxton, still more remote.&nbsp; It is in vain they
do so.&nbsp; The Haymarket may be far off, but the Grecian Saloon
is near; and the young hopefuls come in at half-price, for
sixpence, and smoke their cigars, and do their pale ale, and
adopt the slang and the vices of their betters with too much
ease.&nbsp; And then there are the unfortunates from the
City-road, with painted faces, brazen looks, and gorgeous silks;
mercenary in every thought and feeling, and with hearts hard as
adamant.&nbsp; God help the lad that gets entangled with such as
they!&nbsp; <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>It requires no prophet to foretell
his career.&nbsp; Embezzlement&mdash;first with a view to replace
the sum appropriated to guilty pleasures,&mdash;then,
embezzlement hopelessly continued because once begun,&mdash;then
discovery, and punishment, and shame, and despair.&nbsp; Youth
must have its pleasures, I know.&nbsp; Young blood is not torpid
like that of age; and song and woman will ever be dear till time
furrows the brow and silvers the hair.&nbsp; But why need we seek
them where the air is contaminated&mdash;where the
evening&rsquo;s amusement will not bear the morning&rsquo;s
reflection&mdash;where, though pleasure lead the way, scattering
sweet flowers, vice and shame and premature old age bring up the
rear?&nbsp; Look at those lads; they cannot have been long
emancipated from school.&nbsp; The erect collar, the straight
hat, the long coat, indicate the fact that they belong to the
Young England party; and here, listening to indifferent songs,
and witnessing inferior dramatic performances, and associating
with the refuse of the other sex, they are learning to be
men.&nbsp; What a manhood to look forward to!&nbsp; And if there
be no excuse for them, there is still less for what I may call
the domestic part of the audience,&mdash;the fat old women with
their baskets <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>filled with prog, the pursy old
tradesmen that drop in to smoke a pipe, and the various tribes of
gents and bagsmen on their way home from the city.</p>
<p>Let me say a word on our domestic life.&nbsp; When there is so
little difference between the majority of men and women, why
should the line of demarcation be so severely drawn?&nbsp; We
talk very prettily about home, sweet home, and poets sing its
love and purity and charms; and a popular picture is that which
the artist draws when he groups together the gray-haired
grandfather and grandmother, seated by the fire, and father and
mother by their side, and brave lads and graceful girls around
listening, by the warm light of the lamp, to some tale of manly
struggle or Christian chivalry, or lifting up together the glad
voice of song.&nbsp; But why should your son or mine, immediately
he goes out into the world and leaves the parental roof, become a
stranger to all this?&nbsp; If the Englishman&rsquo;s home be his
castle, why should we cast out into the ditch, to lie down and
die in its mire, all who are not of the family?&nbsp; Think of
the thousands and thousands of young men who yearly come up to
town, strangers to every one, <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and with no
chance of getting into female society, except such as they find
at such places as the Eagle.&nbsp; These women are not lovelier
than you meet with in respectable houses&mdash;not better
educated nor more correct in their principles; yet, as by natural
instinct one sex seeks the society of the other, we condemn our
youth to the company of such.&nbsp; Paterfamilias is afraid the
young men will pay attention to his daughters.&nbsp; Perhaps the
young lady-daughters fancy it to be beneath them to be civil to
their father&rsquo;s young men.&nbsp; Perhaps the young men
themselves believe that an honourable connexion is beyond their
means, and deliberately pursue a career of vice.&nbsp; In all
these cases, in my humble opinion, very serious blunders are
involved.&nbsp; The life of a bachelor under the circumstances I
here allude to is quite as costly as that of a married man,
without the stimulus to exertion which the latter has.&nbsp;
Paterfamilias forgets that the young man he fears may be the
suitor for his daughter&rsquo;s hand, though he is poor to-day,
may be comparatively rich to-morrow; and the young ladies should
remember that it is rather too much to expect that a young man
just entering upon life will be able to launch out in the same
style as those who for thirty or <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>forty years
have been pursuing a successful commercial career.&nbsp; It is
our false pride that eats us up,&mdash;that makes us sneer at
love in a cottage,&mdash;that turns our women into cross old
maids, and our men into gay Lotharios, very disreputable and, to
a certain extent, deliriously gay.&nbsp; I admit that we have
much more outside respectability, but is society the
better?&nbsp; Have we more true happiness?&nbsp; If Wordsworth is
correct, &ldquo;plain living and high thinking&rdquo; go
together.&nbsp; But our aim is high living, and I fear the
thinking is very, very plain in consequence.&nbsp; We nurse up in
our midst, and reverently worship&mdash;and denounce as worse
than an infidel every one who utters the truth respecting
it&mdash;an aristocracy the richest and most luxurious in the
world,&mdash;an aristocracy which would long ere this have become
intellectually effete, did it not recruit its ranks from
successful adventurers in the shape of lawyers; and the
commercial classes vying with this aristocracy in outward show,
the effects are manifest all over the land, in the general
attempts to live beyond one&rsquo;s means, and to get into a
circle supposed to be superior to that in which originally we
moved.&nbsp; In Germany they manage better; the noble and the
trading classes never <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>have a rivalry, the gulf is
impassable, and hence the home life is less pretentious and
happier than ours.&nbsp; In England &ldquo;the toe of the peasant
comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his
kibe.&rdquo;&nbsp; What we want is a return to the plain living
and high thinking of an age gone by; less show and more reality;
the destruction of the wall of partition, either of poverty or of
false pride, and the widening and enhancing the charms of the
domestic circle.&nbsp; If now and then the result is a marriage
not very intelligible on pecuniary principles, let us consider
even that as a lesser evil than that resulting from the
companionship, on the part of our youths, with the women who
infest such places as the Eagle, and without which it is clear
such places could not pay.</p>
<p>I will call evidence as to the character of the amusements at
the Eagle Tavern.&nbsp; In the parliamentary report on
public-houses, I find Mr Balfour is examined respecting it.&nbsp;
He says, &ldquo;The most detrimental place of which I know, as
far as women are concerned, is the Eagle Tavern in the
City-road.&nbsp; There are gardens, and statues round the
gardens, and everything to attract.&nbsp; There is a large
theatre, and there <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>are theatrical representations
during the week.&nbsp; I have seen women there whom I have
recognised next day as common street-walkers.&nbsp; The gardens
are open, with alcoves and boxes on each side, and lads and young
persons are taken in there and plied with drink.&nbsp; The house
is opened on Sunday evening, but on Sunday evening there is no
dramatic representation nor music.&nbsp; I have seen gentlemen
come out drunk.&rdquo;&nbsp; On a Sunday night when Mr Balfour
visited the place, he said, &ldquo;There were various
rooms.&nbsp; There is what is called the Chinese-room, the
ball-room, and the concert-room.&nbsp; They were all filled with
persons drinking, and I saw a great number of female servants,
and females of a certain description; there is no doubt upon that
subject at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Mr Conquest, the present
proprietor, must have read all this evidence, yet I do not see
that he has taken any steps to reform the evil complained
of.&nbsp; It pays, I suppose, and that is enough.&nbsp; Much
money has been made by it.&nbsp; The late proprietor retired a
wealthy man.&nbsp; The present proprietor, we presume, trusts to
do the same, and if the establishment panders to vice, if women
date their ruin to Sunday evenings there, if mothers see <!--
page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>their sons robbed of all that would make them decent
men owing to their visits there, what&rsquo;s the odds? cries the
dram-seller, who, like another Cain, asks if he be his
brother&rsquo;s keeper.</p>
<p>The regular attendants see this not.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
beautiful place,&rdquo; says Mrs Smith to Mrs Robinson,
&ldquo;a&rsquo;nt it, my dear?&rdquo; as they sit eating
questionable sausage rolls, and indulging in bottled beer.&nbsp;
They see the pictures in the balcony, and think the gas jets
quite miraculous, and admire the weak fountains and ambitious
grottoes&mdash;and they laugh even at the comic singer, a feat I
cannot achieve anyhow.&nbsp; Evidently the Eagle Tavern audience
is of the same genus as an Adelphi audience, a people easily
moved to laughter, and much given to taking their meals with
them,&mdash;a people not prone to look before or after,&mdash;who
would be drowned rather than get up and walk into the Ark, and
who see no chance of their own house being burnt down in the fact
that their neighbour&rsquo;s house is in flames.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe naturally men or women are these dull clods,
but custom makes them such, and they see no danger, nor perhaps
is there where they are concerned.</p>
<h2><!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.</h2>
<p>A few<span class="smcap"> </span>miles from the terminus of
one of our metropolitan railways is an immense plot of buildings,
looking more like a town than a single house.&nbsp; It is a
stately pile, beautifully situated, and I doubt not many a
care-worn Cockney, as he has been hurried past it by the rail,
has often wished that he had a little niche in it where he could
come of a night after the day&rsquo;s toil was over, and smell
the sweet flowers and the fresh grass; yet the place is a lunatic
asylum, and whilst I write there are in it fourteen hundred men
and women bereft of reason, unaccountable for their actions, and
shut up away from their fellows.&nbsp; Very often the number is
much greater, and yet this does not contain all the pauper
lunatics of the metropolitan county.&nbsp; There is another
equally large on another line of railway, and there are
Wandsworth, Bedlam, and others in London itself.</p>
<p>It would do some of the noisy poor, who waste <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>their time in low pot-houses talking of their
rights&mdash;when all that a man has a right to is what he can
get&mdash;good to look over such a place as Colney Hatch.&nbsp;
There are pauper lunatics lodged in a palace, waited on by
skilful male and female attendants, living in light and airy
galleries, as clean as wax-work, with four meals a day, and with
every want supplied.&nbsp; I am sure every Englishman must
confess that our asylums and hospitals are the glory of our
land.&nbsp; None can deny the active and practical character of
the philanthropy of our days.&nbsp; You may depend upon it,
nine-tenths of the men and women here were never so well fed,
lodged, and cared for before.&nbsp; Their day commences at six,
and terminates at eight.&nbsp; Such of them as can be usefully
employed are, in cleaning the wards, and in various domestic
duties; but they have plenty of spare time&mdash;the women for
sewing or knitting, and the men for out-door exercise or
reading.&nbsp; In one ward I found some good books on the table,
such as Boswell&rsquo;s Johnson, Gibbon&rsquo;s Life, popular
works on science, and <i>Punch</i> and several magazines.&nbsp;
The only woman I saw reading was an old one, with a Bible before
her.&nbsp; The women are by far more troublesome <!-- page
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>than the men.&nbsp; Directly I went into one ward, a
middle-aged woman advanced towards me, with one arm uplifted,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Here comes my husband, King John.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another female, still plainer and more elderly, seemed inclined
to address to me endearments of a still tenderer character.&nbsp;
It was clear that they retained the instincts of their sex
without its clearness.&nbsp; Yet there were some to whom the
novelty of a stranger offered no excitement&mdash;who sat huddled
up by the window, with scowling eyes and dishevelled hair,
flesh-and-blood pictures of despair.&nbsp; This one had led a gay
life&mdash;what a termination for a votary of pleasure!&nbsp;
That one had become what she was by drinking; this one again by
the grand passion, which underlies all history, past and
present&mdash;all philosophy, objective or subjective&mdash;all
religion, true or false.&nbsp; But, hark! it is a quarter to one,
and that is the dinner bell.&nbsp; We enter the hall, a room
capable of holding seven or eight hundred persons.&nbsp; Some
enormous Yorkshire puddings, with some excellent beef, are borne
by several eager assistants (patients) on to the tables in the
middle of the room; they are immediately cut up, and each portion
is enough for one person&rsquo;s dinner.&nbsp; When <!-- page
230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>the tables set apart for the women are served, the door
opens, and in rush the poor creatures in a manner that shows they
have not lost their relish for food.&nbsp; On the men&rsquo;s
side similar preparations are made, and then in they rush; and
when all are seated, a blessing is asked, and dinner commences:
it does not last long.&nbsp; As soon as the patients have cut up
their pudding, the knives and forks are carefully
removed&mdash;and in a very few minutes a signal is made; they
all rise&mdash;thanks are returned, and the meal is
over&mdash;such as have not had enough generally managing to
collar a bit of pudding as they march out.&nbsp; This is very
short work, you say, but it is quite long enough.&nbsp; You will
hear a woman screaming now and then, short as it is, and an
attempt will be sure to be made to get over to the men&rsquo;s
side before the meal is over.&nbsp; You see enough to sadden you,
but the worst cases you do not see&mdash;they are wisely
concealed from the curious eye; it is enough to know that they
are humanely tended.&nbsp; Why should we care to look on
such?&nbsp; Going down a stair-case, I saw through a glass door a
poor creature suffering from suicidal monomania; night and day
she had to be watched, and such had been the case for
years.&nbsp; In her sad <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>face there
was visible to the most superficial observer</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
settled gloom<br />
The fabled Hebrew wanderer bore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well might she wish to lay down her life, that her crazed
brain had rendered insupportable.</p>
<p>It is a sad sight that of an assembly of insane men and
women.&nbsp; At the asylum to which I refer they are very humane
people, and very successful in their treatment of the distressing
cases constantly occurring, and twice a year&mdash;at Christmas
and Midsummer&mdash;they give an entertainment, at which the
better-behaved lunatics attend, and seemingly enjoy themselves
very much.&nbsp; I was recently at one, and when I arrived, found
that a field adjoining the asylum had been set apart for the
purpose.&nbsp; There were about five hundred lunatics, male and
female, present, and besides there were several gentlemen and
ladies present, spectators like myself.&nbsp; It was a lovely
afternoon, and there was music and dancing, and playing cricket,
and battledore and shuttlecock, and all the various enjoyments of
out-door life; but in all these matters I found the attendants
appeared to take the initiative; still the poor creatures seemed
to <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>enjoy themselves much, and were happy in their
way.&nbsp; Yet the pleasure-seeker will not go to such a
spectacle again.&nbsp; I do not say the vulgar idea of the maniac
was realized; on the contrary, the poor creatures seemed decent
and very well behaved&mdash;but there was a pitiable want of fine
physical development, there were in abundance crooked forms and
stunted figures.&nbsp; You do not like to see what a poor thing
is man when his reason is dethroned.&nbsp; Of course the
refractory patients we do not see on such occasions, but, looking
up at a window, I saw one woman&rsquo;s face&mdash;as she viewed
the scene in which she might not participate&mdash;so wild in its
anger and hopeless in its despair, that that face haunts me
yet.&nbsp; It set me thinking how a woman could get into that
state.&nbsp; Perhaps her father and mother, ignorant of
physiological laws, had married, and she had been the result; or
the ignorance of her friends, or her own ignorance&mdash;or the
competition of modern life&mdash;or the wrongdoing of
others&mdash;had precipitated a catastrophe which otherwise might
never have occurred, and thus society pays indirectly for its
ignorance far more than it would have to do for a genuine useful
education.&nbsp; Think of what desolated homes <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>these poor
creatures form a portion.&nbsp; Remember what a fearful cost it
is to the respectable hard-working amongst us, who can barely
manage to make two ends meet, to have to rear such palatial
residences for our pauper lunatics.&nbsp; The asylum of which I
write in its erection cost the county an enormous sum&mdash;in
its maintenance it does ditto&mdash;and I hear it is now in an
insecure state, firm as it looks, and that the county of
Middlesex will have to spend upon it some tens of thousands of
pounds more.</p>
<p>I once visited this place in the winter-time; a large hall was
lighted up, and there were some very pretty dissolving views
exhibited, and there was dancing and music and eating and
drinking going on.&nbsp; The room was covered with laurels and
flowers and banners, and, of course, there were many ladies and
gentlemen present, and the place had a cheerful air; and all
confessed it was a good thing to give the poor creatures a little
innocent amusement.&nbsp; But only think of dancing with
lunatics&mdash;and such ugly ones too&mdash;and being held by the
buttonhole by some wild-eyed ancient mariner.&nbsp; Coleridge
might have come here and written:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>&ldquo;He held him with his
glistening eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wedding guest stood still,<br />
And listen&rsquo;d like a child&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mariner has his will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if the wedding guest stays here long, he would not be in a
fit state for the wedding&mdash;and still less would he be so if
he goes over the building.&nbsp; What a contrast the present
treatment of lunatics is to that which prevailed till
lately!&nbsp; The exposure of the wretched system pursued at
Bethlem, which took place in 1814, in consequence of the
investigation of a parliamentary committee, appears to have been
productive of great good.&nbsp; The visitors thus describe one of
the women&rsquo;s galleries:&mdash;&ldquo;One of the side-rooms
contained about ten patients, each chained by one arm or leg to
the wall, the chain allowing them merely to stand up by the bench
or form fixed to the wall, or sit down again.&nbsp; The nakedness
of each patient was covered by a blanket gown only.&nbsp; The
blanket gown is a blanket formed something like a dressing gown,
with nothing to fasten it in parts.&nbsp; The feet even were
naked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many women were locked up in cells, naked and
chained, on straw, with only one blanket for a covering; and the
windows <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>being unglazed, the light in winter
was shut out for the sake of warmth.&nbsp; In the men&rsquo;s
rooms, their nakedness and their mode of confinement, continues
the report from which we have already quoted, gave this room the
appearance of a dog-kennel.&nbsp; At this period the committee
for months together made no inspection of the inmates.&nbsp; The
house surgeon was in an insane state himself, and still oftener
drunk; and the keepers were often in the latter state; yet at
this very time the governors spent &pound;600 in opposing a bill
for regulating mad-houses, and I dare say they cried out lustily,
No centralization!&mdash;no interference with vested interests!
as enlightened Englishmen and parochial dignitaries are wont to
do in our days.</p>
<p>Could we not do without lunatic asylums, if society gave up
its drinking customs?&nbsp; Not exactly; but their number might
be very much decreased.&nbsp; Two-thirds of our lunatics become
so through drink.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are very bad at first,
sir,&rdquo; said one of my informants to me, &ldquo;but after a
little while they get quieter, and perhaps they are cured in two
or three months.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet I find all these lunatics
are supplied with beer.&nbsp; &ldquo;They has two half-pints a
day, sir, and <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>when they work they gets two
half-pints more, and very good beer it is, sir,&rdquo; continued
my informant, &ldquo;as strong as any man need
drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now is not this preposterous?&nbsp; Men who
drink till they become lunatics should be taught to do without
it; but they are allowed their beer even in the asylum, and when
they go out they begin drinking again, and of course
relapse.&nbsp; Thus we keep feeding our lunatic asylums, at the
very time we profess to cure lunatics.&nbsp; I admit these places
are in many respects well managed&mdash;that the buildings are
commodious&mdash;that the attention is good&mdash;that the
governors are humane, and the medical officers vigilant; but
which is the truer humanity, to take care of the man when in a
lunatic asylum, or to keep him out of it altogether?</p>

<h3>THE LONDON PULPIT.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">by</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">JAMES EWING RITCHIE.</p>
<p>Contents: The Religious Denominations of London&mdash;Sketches
of the Rev. J. M.
Bellew&mdash;Dale&mdash;Liddell&mdash;Maurice&mdash;Melville&mdash;Villiers&mdash;Baldwin
Brown&mdash;Binney&mdash;Dr
Campbell&mdash;Lynch&mdash;Morris&mdash;Martin&mdash;Brock&mdash;Howard

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>
<p>The subject is an interesting one, and it is treated with very
considerable ability.&nbsp; Mr Ritchie has the valuable art of
saying many things in few words; he is never diffuse, never dull,
and succeeds in being graphic without becoming flippant.&nbsp;
Occasionally his strength of thought and style borders rather too
closely on coarseness; but this fault of vigorous natures is
counterbalanced by compensatory merits&mdash;by an utter absence
of cant, a manly grasp of thought, and a wise and genial
human-heartedness.&nbsp; The book is a sincere book; the writer
says what he means, and means what he says.&nbsp; In these
half-earnest days it is a comfort to meet with any one who has
&ldquo;the courage of his opinions,&rdquo; especially on such a
subject as the &ldquo;London Pulpit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily
News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the cleverest productions of the present
day.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Herald</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;Mr Ritchie is just the man to dash off a series
of portraits, bold in outline, strikingly like the originals in
feature and expression, and characterized by bright and effectual
colouring.&nbsp; We have here photographed a group of the most
distinguished pulpit orators of the metropolis, of all religious
denominations and sects.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Civil Service
Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The style of Mr Ritchie is always lively and fluent,
and oftentimes eloquent.&nbsp; It comes the nearest to
Hazlitt&rsquo;s of any modern writer we know.&nbsp; His views and
opinions are always clear, manly, and unobjectionable as regards
the manner in which they are set forth.&nbsp; Many, no doubt,
will not agree with them, but none can be offended at them.&nbsp;
As we have already remarked, Mr Ritchie does not write as a
sectarian, and it is impossible to collect from the treatise to
what sect he belongs.&nbsp; The tendency of these sketches is to
introduce into the pulpit a better style of preaching than what
we have been accustomed to.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Critic</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Ritchie has written in a graphic, nervous, and most
just spirit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Court Circular</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Written in a fluent and easy
style.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Weekly Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The personal sketches will engage attention; for the
author has evidently been a close and attentive
observer.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>News of the World</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Ritchie&rsquo;s pen-and-ink sketches of the popular
preachers of London are as life-like as they are brilliant and
delightful.&nbsp; The thought of producing them was a happy one,
and has been carried out in the volume before us with much
agreeable animation.&nbsp; The collection of silhouettes herein
presented to our contemplation will be especially acceptable, we
conjecture, to our country cousins, as a guide among the more
generally known of the metropolitan ecclesiastics.&nbsp; It will
be perceived at a glance that the writer has familiarized himself
with the subject, before undertaking its treatment.&nbsp; Chapter
after chapter brings the popular preachers of the Capital before
our mind&rsquo;s eye in a sort of stately clerical
procession.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Sun</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without going so far as the late Sir Robert Peel, and
saying that there are three ways of viewing this as well as <!--
page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>every other subject, it will be allowed that the
clerical body may be contemplated either from within one of their
special folds, and under the influence of peculiar religious
views, or in a purely lay historical manner, and, so we suppose
we ought to say, from the &lsquo;platform of humanity&rsquo; at
large.&nbsp; The latter is the idea developed in Mr
Ritchie&rsquo;s volume, and cleverly and amusingly it is
done.&nbsp; One great merit is, that his characters are not
unnecessarily spun out.&nbsp; We have a few rapid dashes of the
pencil, and then the mind is relieved by a change of scene and
person . . . He displays considerable discrimination of judgment,
and a good deal of humour.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Inquirer</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is considerable verisimilitude in these sketches,
though they are much too brief to be regarded as more than mere
outlines.&nbsp; It is possible, however, to throw character even
into an outline, and this is done with good effect in several of
these smart and off-hand
compositions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Tait</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is lively, freshly written, at times powerful, and
its facts carefully put together.&nbsp; It bears the stamp of an
earnest spirit, eager in its search after truth, and strongly set
against affectation and pretence of every
sort.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Globe</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the sketches are very
good.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are penned in a just spirit, and are of a
character to afford all the information that may be needed on the
subjects to which they refer.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s criticisms
on preachers and preaching are candid, and for the most part
truthful.&nbsp; This book ought therefore to be
popular.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Observer</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are written with vigour and freedom, and are
marked by a spirit of fairness and justice&mdash;an admirable
trait, if we recollect how much the spirit of partisanship
governs such strictures as a rule.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Weekly
Dispatch</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sketch of the comparative force of the religious
denominations in London, and notes upon the chief popular
preachers, orthodox or dissentient, republished from a
newspaper&mdash;we think the Weekly News and Chronicle.&nbsp; The
book, which is written in a sufficiently impartial spirit, will
interest many people, and offend
few.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;In this volume we have within a moderate space
pen-and-ink sketches of most of the popular preachers of the
metropolis.&nbsp; We are bound to say that they are drawn with
fidelity, and that the admirers of each Sabbath orator whose
mental lineaments are placed before us will easily recognise the
prominent features of the original.&nbsp; Although brief, they
evince discrimination and talent; a fluent style being one of
their chief recommendations, not much space is devoted to
each.&nbsp; The writer only reviews the most striking
characteristics, and his sympathies are manifestly with those who
display most liberal and manly tendencies in their religious
expositions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sunday Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mr Francis did some few years since for the
parliamentary orators of the age, Mr Ritchie has in the volume
before us effected for the pulpit orators of the day.&nbsp; In
brief but graphic delineations, he gives daguerreotypes, as it
were, of the living manners of the chief popular preachers of
various Christian denominations.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Church and
State Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a second edition of Mr Ritchie&rsquo;s smart
little sketches taken from the life of the most noted
metropolitan preachers.&nbsp; The outline is bold, rather than
minute and diffuse; now and then character is seized with
remarkable fidelity; whilst the genial spirit which generally
pervades the volume takes from occasional passages approaching
censure anything like the sting of bitterness.&nbsp; There is
scarcely a page that does not give the reader faith in the
sincerity of the writer.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Manchester Examiner and
Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His sketches are characterized by a boldness, freedom,
and vigour, which are rarely to be met with in works of that
class.&nbsp; He is no hero-worshipper, but he shows that he has a
keen appreciation of the higher forms of pulpit
eloquence.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The People</i>.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
